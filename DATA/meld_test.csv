"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.",joy,0
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.,surprise,0
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...,sadness,0
"What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?",anger,0
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """,anger,0

"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.",anger,0
That's OK.,neutral,0
"Oh, are you sure?",surprise,0
"Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.",anger,0
We can't do that.,neutral,0
What? What can't you do?,surprise,0
She really said that?,surprise,0
"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...",neutral,0

'Tonight' tonight?,surprise,0

"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.",joy,0
"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.",disgust,0
"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?",neutral,0
"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.",neutral,0
"Alright, well, be good, I love you.",joy,0
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.,anger,0
"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.",sadness,0
Really stupid.,anger,0

"I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store",disgust,0
What?!,surprise,0
A new grocery store.,neutral,0
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?,anger,0

A little.   Now youre talking.,neutral,0
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?,neutral,0

"Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!",joy,0
"So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.",joy,0
"Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.",neutral,0
"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.",anger,0
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.,disgust,0
I was shrieking... like a Marine.,neutral,0
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.,neutral,0

"Ok, look, maybe I should just go.",neutral,0
Maybe you should.,anger,0
"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?",sadness,0
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.,neutral,0

"Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.",sadness,0
No-noReally?!,surprise,0
Of course!,joy,0
"Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh",sadness,0
"Ohh, Im sorry.",sadness,0
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.,neutral,0

"This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?",fear,0
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?,surprise,0
"Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.",neutral,0
"Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on",neutral,0
"Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!",sadness,0

Sure!,joy,0
"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?",neutral,0
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!,joy,0
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!,joy,0
"Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.",neutral,0
"Well, I like that idea.",joy,0
Obviously!,joy,0
"I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?",neutral,0
"I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like",neutral,0
No.,disgust,0
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely.""",joy,0
"Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",disgust,0
"So, thats it?",surprise,0
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,neutral,0
Which is why,neutral,0
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,anger,0
"I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",anger,0
Are you mocking me?,anger,0

"Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.",neutral,0
Why not?!,anger,0
Because Im dumping him today.,neutral,0
What?! You said he was sweet!,surprise,0
He,neutral,0
Just dont pick up your phone.,neutral,0
"Then he comes over!  ""Im so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",disgust,0
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?,surprise,0
"You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.",sadness,0
"Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",neutral,0
"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill",disgust,0
"Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!",neutral,0
Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,sadness,0
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.,neutral,0
"Well, I-I guess I gotta go.",sadness,0

"Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.",neutral,0
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?,surprise,0
"The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?",anger,0
"Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.",anger,0
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?,sadness,0
"I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!",anger,0

"Yeah, maybe.",sadness,0
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.,sadness,0
Any luck?,sadness,0
"Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?",sadness,0

She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.,anger,0
You're not an artist.,neutral,0
"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.",anger,0

"Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.",neutral,0
Oh please.,neutral,0
Every moment is precious.,sadness,0

"Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.",sadness,0
"Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.",neutral,0
"On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.",sadness,0
"No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.",anger,0
"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",neutral,0
"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",neutral,0
"So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.",neutral,0
"We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",neutral,0
"Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.",joy,0

I thought I was making him filet mignon?,surprise,0
"Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.",neutral,0
"And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.",anger,0
"Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.",surprise,0
"Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!",sadness,0
"Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.",fear,0
"Yknow its like uh, Biology!",neutral,0
"Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.",fear,0

"Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.",neutral,0
"Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",sadness,0
Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.,neutral,0
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,surprise,0
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,neutral,0

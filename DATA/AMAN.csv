" I remember being so impressed, with the youth programs of the other parishes in my area, and the stong bond that everyone had withen their own groups, regardless of the social status of each person",neutral,0

 Broadcasting this time from the New World,neutral,0
" It's been a solid half year since I sent word out, and I will now attempt to encapsulate the last six months into one last epic email",neutral,0
" Exciting, no?",happy,0
" So, to the task!",neutral,0
 Well,neutral,0
 where did we leave off?,neutral,0
" I believe it was April, and spring had just arrived",neutral,0
 I'll start my narrative with a little anecdote about how small the world really is,neutral,0
" I had never been to this particular hostel before, and as I entered and gave my little spiel about the tour and asked if anyone wanted to come along, I was met not with a roar of enthusiasm from the hostel residents, but rather a few dull, glass-eyed looks and was generally ignored",neutral,0
" As I was preparing to leave, one guy over at the computers yelled out for me to wait, approached me and said hello",neutral,0
" He had arrived twenty minutes beforehand at the hostel, hadn't even checked in yet, and just happened to be in the lobby when I was",neutral,0
 So he just took his backpack with him and came on my tour,neutral,0
" We had a great time catching up, and went out that night together as well",happy,0
" But it's certainly strange how you randomly run in to people you haven't seen in years, in little hole-in-the-walls in Europe",surprise,0
 Fun times,happy,0
" The rest of April passed rather uneventfully, and in May I went to see a production of Faust Part I at the Deutsches Theater",neutral,0
 And this particular piece was by far the best play I have EVER seen,happy,0
" It was also incredibly simple, cutting the normally huge cast down to only seven performers",surprise,0
 It's moments like that that remind me why I've chosen theatre as a profession,neutral,0
 My next big adventure was a trip I took to London at the end of May,neutral,0
" I was lucky enough to be able to stay with some friends to cut down on the cost, and see a different side of London life",happy,0
 It was sooooo much fun!,happy,0
" I saw most of the major sites on my own, and I went to the theater almost every night I was there",neutral,0
 The show was trash,disgust,0
 Horrible,disgust,0
" Horribly acted, horribly directed, weak script",disgust,0
 And interminably long!,disgust,0
 Three hours of horror,disgust,0
" I wanted to leave at intermission, but my date was really enjoying it (should have been a sign) so we stayed",happy,0
 I guess the one good thing I took from it was that I know now that the British are just as capable as we are of producing really awful work,disgust,0
" It was nice to understand that, just wish I didn't have to experience it first hand",neutral,0
 While in London I also saw Coriolanus at the Globe Theater,neutral,0
 Now this was amazing,surprise,0
" Shakespeare, old school",neutral,0
" The performers were incredible, and one of the generals was played by Geoffrey, the butler from Fresh Prince of Bellaire",surprise,0
" That in itself was hilarious, and made us love the show even more",happy,0
" I also saw Les Miserables for the first time, and it was fun",happy,0
 Loved London,happy,0
 Loved the free museums,happy,0
 Especially the British Museum,neutral,0
 Great East London accents,neutral,0
" Soooo many monuments, including two statues in front of Buckingham Palace that had a conspicuous Communist message",neutral,0
" It was a worker with a hammer and a peasant woman with a sickle situated behind Queen Victoria's back , and glowering at the palace",neutral,0
" Now maybe I was just reading too much into this, or maybe I had spent too much time in the eastern bloc talking about Communist symbolism",neutral,0
 But I don't' think so,neutral,0
" And the funniest part, the two statues said they were donated by New Zealand",happy,0
 Curious,surprise,0
" next time you're in Wellington, watch out for the Kiwi Commies!",neutral,0
 After London came the World Cup,neutral,0
 Now I have a confession to make: before the World Cup began I had actually never seen an entire soccer game from start to finish,neutral,0
 That changed very quickly,neutral,0
" The hordes of people would change from day to day, for instance there was a three day period where we had over 90,000 Swedes in the city, leading up to their dramatic defeat at the hands of Zeh Germans",surprise,0
" Then there were the Brazilians, everywhere, singing-clapping-dancing-taking pictures, and of course the pale and pasty Brits with their cock-eyed stares and drinking songs",happy,0
 Loads of fun,happy,0
" I didn't have tickets to any of the games, but my group of friends would always go to a cafe or bar of the nationality that was playing to watch the match",neutral,0
" So to a French cafe for the France-Swiss game, a Tapas bar when Spain played, drank Caiprinhas with the passionate Brazilians, etc",happy,0
" And let me tell you how good the World Cup was for Berlin as a city, and Germany as a nation",neutral,0
 Another interesting element was the latent patriotism that emerged during the Cup,surprise,0
" Now this merits explaining: before the World Cup began, if you waved a German flag in the streets, you would probably be called a Nazi and at the very least labeled as a radical right wing nutter",neutral,0
 You have to understand that the Germans have had a really difficult time with their national identity (and subsequently national pride or patriotism of any kind) since the Second World War,neutral,0
" And for what it's worth I agree with them, it makes me nervous too",fear,0
 So,neutral,0
" People were genuinely excited about supporting their national team, and taking pride in its accomplishments",happy,0
 Now this newfound enthusiasm certainly was not shared by everyone,happy,0
" In fact the entire month of June was one continuous debate in the media between prominent politicians, celebrities, writers (such as Guenther Grass and Christa Wolf), and other intellectuals about the meaning, origin and impact of this nationalism",neutral,0
 And of course no one can laboriously dissect an idea better than the Germans,neutral,0
 But the general consensus after five weeks of debate was that the newfound national pride was a positive thing,neutral,0
" In June I had also been training at work to lead tours of Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, which I started at the end of the month",neutral,0
" This camp, about 40 miles north of Berlin was the second major camp to be opened in the Nazi system, and was also used by the Russians after the war to intern former Nazi's and anyone else deemed an 'enemy of the state'",neutral,0
" Given the dark history of such a place you can well imagine the difficulty of retelling that information, and trying to put it into some kind of historical context",neutral,0
 I ended up doing tours out there for the duration of the summer,neutral,0
" After a July of beautiful weather and great summer adventures, I traveled with my good Australian friend Kurt to a theater festival in Cyprus",happy,0
" The occasion was that a good friend of mine from North Texas, Jessica, was playing the title role in Medea at a theater festival there",neutral,0
" I was planning on going to Greece sometime anyway, so we spent three days in Athens, and two and a half in Cyprus",neutral,0
 Now this was ridiculous amounts of fun!,happy,0
" The city is a sweaty, dirty, polluted hole",disgust,0
" Take your impression of a squalor-filled Mediterranean capital, and add this to your image: 10 story apartment buildings everywhere, in 100 degree heat, all cooled by wall-mounted air conditioners, a.a",neutral,0
" Now take into account that said air conditioners are mounted on the windows, sticking out over the street",neutral,0
 Now imagine the condensation from thousands of swamp box coolers pitter pattering on your head as you stroll down the trashy Athens streets,disgust,0
 Now add a couple of poorly placed ancient columns,neutral,0
 But it was close,neutral,0
" And the city itself really is lovely, in it's own way",happy,0
 But two days back to back was more than enough,neutral,0
" We took a day trip out to Sunion, the very tip of Greece, to see the temple of Poseidon",neutral,0
 Now this was really amazing,surprise,0
" It took us about two hours to get out there, and then we climbed around and played on the rocks for about an hour, taking pics of the magnificent old temple ruin that is literally clinging to the cliff face",neutral,0
" And then we watched in amazement with fifty other tourists as the sun went down in front of the temple, over the Mediterranean",surprise,0
" The sky is so amazing in Greece, it feels like you could really reach up and touch it, it's so close!",surprise,0
" And of course this just enhanced the magic of the sunset, as the red orb of  the sun ever so slowly retreated behind the furthest hill",neutral,0
 Just FYI,neutral,0
 They also bake bread for you on the plane so that your in flight meal is fresh,neutral,0
 Not bad,neutral,0
 Cyprus was amazing,surprise,0
" We saw Jessica's production of Medea, and were treated incredibly well by her colleagues at the festival",surprise,0
" We stayed in a tiny mountain village called Droushia, and these people brought hospitality to incredible new heights",surprise,0
" They did everything they could to make us feel welcome, everything from putting us up in a beautiful hotel, refusing to let us pay for anything, and making sure that our stay on their island was as enchanting as the stories always make it out to be",happy,0
 We spent pretty much the whole day (outside of a decadent lunch at the beach house) in the water,neutral,0
 Tomorrow we'll go somewhere special,neutral,0
 And they weren't kidding,neutral,0
" The next morning, the last day of the festival, they piled us all into four wheel drive vehicles, and took us off the map to an area that I will henceforth be labeling The Blue Lagoon",neutral,0
" Imagine the most incredible, horseshoe shaped cove, with unimaginably blue water, and a giant stone underneath the water, hundreds of meters long and wide, adding depth to the color",surprise,0
" What's more, we had the whole place to ourselves",neutral,0
 Our hosts had brought along a lunch of fresh fruit and we broke our fast on a cliff overlooking the whole gorgeous expanse,neutral,0
" It was really interesting staying with them in this little mountain village, and getting to experience a bit of what their culture was all about",happy,0
 Oh and the food is incredible,surprise,0
" They make their own very strong coffee, and Haloumi cheese, which we were told (a hundred different times by all the little old ladies) was goat cheese",neutral,0
 But not feta,neutral,0
 Haloumi,neutral,0
 Haloumi has nothing to do with Feta,neutral,0
" Don't ever mistake Haloumi for Feta, or you might have a flock of barely intelligible Cypriot grammas spend half an hour pinching your cheek and explaining the difference in broken Greco-English",neutral,0
" Its really a testament to the vision of the ancients that in our world of skyscrapers and technical gadgetry, we are still fascinated by a two thousand year-old arrangement of stones",happy,0
 After returning from Greece my last few weeks in Berlin passed very quickly,neutral,0
" I was leading loads of tours, and working on a short film I was directing",neutral,0
" The time flew by and before I knew it, August was at an end and my doorstep was graced by my best friend Lance, who had come to Berlin for my last week",neutral,0
" So I spent the next six days in a haze of working my final tours, partying, and showing Lance the city that I had come to love so much over the last two years",happy,0
 Lance and I spent the better part of the next three days lounging around Zurich and drinking in Switzerland,neutral,0
 People say London or Paris is expensive; no,neutral,0
 Zurich is expensive,neutral,0
 But we didn't let that discourage us,neutral,0
 We had a ball in Zurich,happy,0
" We went on a walking tour, went to the City Museum (located in an old castle, very cool), and had a good time relaxing and enjoying the AMAZING views",happy,0
" The city is incredibly beautiful, tucked into the Alps and right on the water",surprise,0
" After our detox detour en Suisse, we headed via night train to Paris",neutral,0
" I think the most important thing I can say about this city, is that all of the rumors: That the city's dirty, the people are rude, the language barrier is insurmountable, the metro is incomprehensible, you things will be stolen, that they hate Americans",disgust,0
 It's called the city of love and light for a reason,neutral,0
" The Eiffel Tower is breathtaking, and seeing it in person destroys its cliche and makes you fall in love with the thing",happy,0
 The people are absolutely LOVELY,happy,0
" We encountered so many genuinely wonderful, helpful, content people",happy,0
" Everything from trying to order a baguette in the morning (my Francais is tres terrible) to asking directions or talking to cabbies, we were always pleasantly surprised at how open and welcoming they were",surprise,0
 And they all seem to really enjoy their city,happy,0
" They know how beautiful it is, and they appreciate it",happy,0
" And man, it is gorgeous",happy,0
" So many public spaces, parks museums, gardens",neutral,0
 And people are out in them all the time,neutral,0
 There was a fabulous sense of community there,happy,0
 My favorite part about the city parks were the 'nap chairs',happy,0
" So we went across the street to the park, it was about 2:00 pm",neutral,0
" There were people all over the place, and lots of benches and chairs",neutral,0
 We noticed that about half of the chairs were slanted at a 45 degree angle,neutral,0
" I thought: ""that's strange, what's that about?""",surprise,0
" We found out when we headed over to two of these chairs that were situated in the shade, and plopped down",neutral,0
 They were perfect for taking a catnap,neutral,0
" We looked around and noticed that there were lots of people all over the park, in the municipal nap chairs, taking a snooze",neutral,0
" Well, when in Rome",neutral,0
 so we did the same,neutral,0
" Had a little hour sleep, got back up and headed back into the colossal Louvre for another few hours",neutral,0
 What other city would use tax payer dollars to provide napping chairs in a public park?,neutral,0
 Vive la France!,happy,0
 We really had a ball in Paris,happy,0
" We went to Versailles, we went to Notre Dame, and on a fabulous bike tour",happy,0
" The most interesting thing we learned on the bike tour was that when the revolutionaries stormed the Bastille, there were only 7 prisoners left in it",surprise,0
 6 were petty thieves and the seventh was a boy whose father had sent him there for a few weeks as  disciplinary measure,neutral,0
" Montmartre, the old bohemian artist district, five minutes from the Sacre Coeur Cathedral",neutral,0
 Every night after dinner we'd climb the hill to the cathedral and sit on the steps,neutral,0
" The Cathedral is the highest point in Paris, and from its northerly vantage point, you have the entire city spread out at your feet",neutral,0
 It's a pretty breathtaking sight,happy,0
 On the steps there was always sort of an impromptu party with musicians and performers and other city-watchers gathering with a bottle of wine and a merry spirit,happy,0
 Those evenings on the steps are some of my favorite memories from Paris,happy,0
" Upon arrival back in the states, we changed clothes and went directly to a Counting Crows concert, which was my birthday present from Lance",neutral,0
 What an incredible end to an incredible journey,surprise,0
" Thus, is my two year Grande Tour at an end",neutral,0
 It took me to 11 different countries and incalculable new experiences,neutral,0
" I've returned ready for a fresh start, collecting new experiences on this side of the pond",neutral,0
" The last few weeks I've been in Lubbock, trying to readjust to life in America and spending lots of time with my family",neutral,0
" I was also lucky enough to be hired to direct a show for Frenship high school, which went up last Sunday",happy,0
" It was a Commedia dell'Arte piece titled The Red Hat, and went extremely well",happy,0
 It was a nice way for me to get to stretch those theater muscles and earn a little something at the same time,happy,0
 And though my European adventure is over (for the moment) my American one starts tomorrow,neutral,0
" I'm moving to Chicago Sunday morning, in the hopes of getting started there as an director and performer",neutral,0
" I'm excited about the move, and the opportunities and challenges that await me there",happy,0
 There was  a lot to pack in,neutral,0
" I hope all of you are well; that you have made it through the summer, and are excited about the upcoming (rapidly approaching) holiday season!",happy,0
" I'll be in New York for New Year's, so if you're going to be in that area, let me know and we'll ring it in together",neutral,0
" I wish you all a fabulous week, and a warm and safe start to the wintry season",happy,0
 All the best till we meet again!,neutral,0
 So,neutral,0
 first day of school,neutral,0
 Yeah,neutral,0
 My classes all seem fine,neutral,0
 Except math,neutral,0
" But math just sucks, and I've accepted that",disgust,0
" Some of my teachers seem quite amazing, and others I know for a fact to be amazing",surprise,0
" So, all-in-all, pretty good, right?",happy,0
" Honestly, while I was dating the child, I barely saw him in school",neutral,0
" Now, I see him all the time, and I'm pretty sure he'll be right outside the door my photography room after class every day for the rest of this trimester",neutral,0
" Unless Brandon and Meg break up, that is",neutral,0
" I also found out that Junior year, will, in fact, be a bitch",disgust,0
 I have recieved homework in four of my seven classes,neutral,0
" AP World is going to be the hardest thing I'll ever do (academically, anyway)",neutral,0
" Ah, well",neutral,0
 It's nothing a strong woman such as myself cannot handle with a little bit of DragonForce and mental pep talks,neutral,0
" (""You can deal with this, Nyssa",neutral,0
 You can handle high school drama,happy,0
 I can come through this year triumphantly and with grace,happy,0

 This is my year to be happy,happy,0
 This is my year to try new things and to succeed!,happy,0
" This is the year when I get to test myself: my mind, my body, and myself",neutral,0
 This is my first year where I am truly Nyssa Jane Towsley,neutral,0
 This is my first year of loving myself,happy,0

 Edit:,neutral,0
 I cannot believe the nerve of this man,surprise,0
 I need to just,neutral,0
 kill something,angry,0
 Paul,neutral,0
 I think I'd really like to talk to you right now,neutral,0
 Blar,neutral,0
" at least they punched holes in it) that is my BIO lab course ""book",neutral,0
" What's even worse, it's copied so poorly that the last half inch of text on the far right side of the page is cut off, so as I try to read in preparation for the lab tomorrow I'm trying to coherently complete sentences and make sense of it all, which is often impossible because so much is left out",angry,0
" AND we're required to have this new kind of remote control clicker which none of the libraries have for (free) check out, so I have to pay $20 (+$12",neutral,0
" Again, makes me so angry",angry,0
" That's like, four or five or more meals!",neutral,0
 Or a new pair of jeans!,neutral,0
 Or two meals in Europe,neutral,0
 Poopy poopy poopy,angry,0
 Can you tell I buy books with my own money?,neutral,0
" They pay room and board, and tuition and that's it",neutral,0
" Which is the bulk of my expenses, but I'm paying for my food outside of campus meal plan food, and my books, and whatever else I need",neutral,0
 So I guess that counts for something,neutral,0
 *cries* Such is life I spose,sad,0
" I am in such a bad mood and I'm playing the blame game in my head, getting angry at people for things that are really quite trivial",angry,0
 I forgot how demeaning BME classes are,angry,0
 Dr,neutral,0
 I haven't,neutral,0
 He was asking all these questions that I was completely baffled by and people were just spouting answers,surprise,0
" Sometimes I wonder how in the world I made it in, and every day I wonder how I'm going to make it through",surprise,0
" Matt and I decided that BME really isn't a good undergrad major, there's a reason it's generally proposed as a Master's degree",neutral,0
" I mean, we already need 133 (ish) hours to graduate which, for you non college people, is about 8-10 more than any engineering major and more than that more for a non engineering major",neutral,0
" In addition to that, we keep encountering classes where the professor expects you to have taken general classes that you haven't (the anatomy/physiology is one, and thermodynamics is another one that Matt is having a problem with)",neutral,0
 I need to find a good time/place where I can go pray and unwind,neutral,0
 I dont' know where that is yet,neutral,0
 I don't feel like I ever have that kind of privacy where I can talk to God and cry and figure things out,sad,0
" I always tear up in church too, for different reasons",sad,0
 I love the way God brings people together,happy,0
 Ok,neutral,0
 I'm going to finish my book before I go to bed,neutral,0
" Girls, I highly reccomend In Her Shoes, especially if you have a sister I'm enjoying it immensely and it has effectively distracted from my schoolwork almost all day",happy,0
 I think I spent the better part of two hours reading today,neutral,0
 I learned that the Life Sciences library in the main building has exceedingly comfortable couches Anyhoo,neutral,0
 I spose I'm off for now,neutral,0
 wherever,neutral,0
" These small indicators remind me that, in the Silvia Plath sense of the concept, I'm dying",sad,0
" Someday I will be no more than slime coating the expensive, cushiony, velvety inside of a coffin",sad,0
" The rickety deck I'm sitting on could fall, I could catch a stray bullet to the noggin on my way to my car in the parking lot, I could be nailed by a drunk, inattentive, careless, or simply unfortunate driver on the way home",fear,0
" These are all unlikely, but they happen",neutral,0
 I see it everyday on the news,neutral,0
" My mortality is nothing new, but I constantly have to ponder what I desire to take, achieve, or feel in this life",neutral,0

" Should I travel to faroff places that have interested me? England, France, Norway, Sweden, Lebanon, Israel, the Vatican?",neutral,0
" Or should I sink my money into trying to acquire more and live in a Parade of Homes house with yuppie vehicles in the front, a Mastercraft boat with a huge ski rack, the list can go on and on",neutral,0
 What happens when I die?,neutral,0
 Does an afterlife really exist?,neutral,0
 That's one hour a week,neutral,0
" Should I start devoting myself to God, if there is such a being, in hopes of making it to Heaven?",neutral,0
 There would be a constant trepedation that there is no gold at the end of that rainbow,fear,0
 Different songs keep on playing,neutral,0
 No wonder past writers were able to produce their amazing feats of feeling and thought,surprise,0
 Their distractions were very limited,neutral,0
" My thoughts at the moment are somewhat melancholy, but can be completely forgotten at the push of a button mounted to an  Xbox, Dvd player, or VCR",sad,0
" For the laziness in me, I feel compelled to fold my laptop, plug it in, and simply watch, but this whole trainwreck, a malformed offspring of a feeble mind, has to come to an end somehow",neutral,0
" The first words that come to mind are ""in closing"" or ""to conclude"", and then I quickly write a summary of what I just finished writing",neutral,0
" Maybe I should stop in mid sentence, just to",neutral,0
 I am now the proud father of Daisy Alexandria Davolls,happy,0
" Its all official, we sorted it out at the civic centre on Friday",neutral,0
" I now have a sweet little thing, that totally depends on her mum and me to do whats best",happy,0
 I have the foresight of Supernanny and Honey we're killing the kids etc to thank as well as my own morals and my parents and peers too,neutral,0
" Its a funny old game life, but I think I am one step closer to understanding its purpose and meaning now",neutral,0
" I had a long hard look at my life over the last 14 days, and to be honest I wept",sad,0
 I wept for all the mistakes I made where I put my feelings before the feelings of others,sad,0
" I wept for all the times I said ""f*ck you"" instead of ""thank you""",sad,0
" I still have a couple of vices, strong coffee and noodles, but have quit smoking, havent drunk for a couple of weeks and am feeling better about life",happy,0
" My job is going really well, and I am getting a kick out of both going to work and coming home",happy,0
" The pessimist in me awaits the phone call from the police or hospital or nuclear plant etc telling me the worst, crushing my hopes of a better tomorrow",fear,0
 what is happiness,neutral,0
 can you buy it?,neutral,0
 can it be sold?,neutral,0
 can you get there and back on a half tank of gas?,neutral,0
 I think you can,neutral,0
 We are all essentially the same person,neutral,0
 other then physical attributes - what really makes us so different from one another,neutral,0
 Theoretically,neutral,0
 is there anything that Einstein did that I couldn't do,neutral,0
 we both have the same tools (a brain) so why can't I come up with a grad theory of relativity,neutral,0
 Simply because that is not where I have been directing my energy to,neutral,0
 The brain is an amazing tool and can be sculpted for any purpose,surprise,0
 however most people don't exert the mental energy required to expand your train of thought,neutral,0
 I believe all brains start out with the same potential and the way they are grown and shaped determined how they operate on default for the rest of your life unless you do something about it,neutral,0
 Have you ever met anyone without a fully developed brain?,neutral,0
 They look at things only on the surface and read into nothing,neutral,0
 Listlessly they scratch at there head and the chains of thought don't delve to deep,neutral,0
 Do they know how lucky they are - to find contentment without looking,happy,0
 more often you find things to bring you down or worry about,sad,0
 A single lightning bolt from the sky can make a lifetime of panic and worry all worthless,fear,0
 I think it is very easy to understand people once you realize that all people carry all the same personalities - just expressed to different proportions and degrees,neutral,0
 Whatever thought can be imagined - someone has taken that to the extreme,neutral,0
 True wisdom is growing your brain in all directions,neutral,0
 Life is finding the balance between compulsion and carelessness,neutral,0
 I am not saying I am anything other then happy - but I strive for a balance,happy,0
 the perfect combination of all attributes,neutral,0
 the combination of all people balanced into one,neutral,0
 as defined by the dictionary,neutral,0
 Balanced,neutral,0
 (of a person or state of mind) having no emotion lacking or too strong; stable : a balanced personality,neutral,0
 Happiness comes from within - your brain is a self regulating chemical factory,happy,0
 but when you try to become your own mental chemist - ingesting chemicals to alter your feelings - you screw up the balance,neutral,0
 This phenomenon can best be seen and proved with steroid users,neutral,0
 The testes stop producing testosterone because it senses there is already too much testosterone in the system,neutral,0
 as a result - the balls shrink up and shut down,neutral,0
 The body is lazy - if you provide something for it - it stops providing for itself,neutral,0
 For example - the more you use chapstick - the less your lips produce their own moisture - making you further dependent on chapstick,neutral,0
 So while Cliche it is true,neutral,0
" ""Happiness lies within"" - the only way to be truly happy is to create it yourself and not rely on other people or things",happy,0
 the Happiness they bring is only temporary,happy,0
 Yet often that temporary happiness is more intense then a balanced contentment,happy,0
 It is however usually accompanied by and equal sadness - it is life's way of balancing itself out in the endless pendulum swing of life,sad,0
" So, this morning I get a phone call from my sister",neutral,0
 First she is all mad because I haven't called her back in a week,angry,0
 Second of all she is laughing hysterically because she had to put her dog on doggie drugs because the dog learned how to open the window to get out and seems to be jewish because she likes the temple down the road,happy,0
" Third she starts asking why I have only posted pics, so my dear sister, this is for you",neutral,0
 She wouldn;t come down today so instead of being bored out of my mind I went antiquing,neutral,0
 I figure I have a couple extra bucks so I budget a certain amount,neutral,0
" Ok, I spent 4 times what I budgeted, but I wanted that desk",neutral,0
" I almost bought this cool shiney glass ""tumbler up"" thingy",neutral,0
" I was dragged away, (it will be there tomorrow and I can go back alone)",neutral,0
" Ok, the alignment was out on her BMW when she bought it and it wiped out the tires",neutral,0
" She didn;t give the dealer a chance to correct the problem, she paid a astronomical amount for new tires without telling the dealer and expected the dealer to reimburse her the full amount",neutral,0
 I tend to think not,neutral,0
 She said that a mechanic told her that the frame was bent,neutral,0
 I called the mechanic and inquired about it,neutral,0
 A shock mount was bad,neutral,0
" On that car, it won't affect alignment",neutral,0
 She started questioning my credentials because she drives a school bus for a living and knows what a safe vehicle is,angry,0
 I have twice the work experience required for the job and I have alot more schooling than is required,neutral,0
 Bitch,angry,0
 I got her less than $500,neutral,0
 Bitch,angry,0
" So when she writes her letter to the Commissioner and the director of vehicle safety reads my report, he will understand why I appear not to take her side",neutral,0
 I made lunch for a luncheon at work yesterday,neutral,0
 Cook up lamb for gyros,neutral,0
 They saw what I meant when they started eating it,neutral,0
 They went back for more,neutral,0
" As far as i can tell, it was a success",happy,0
 They all complimented on it,happy,0
 Killin me he is,happy,0
" Well, what can I say, he has a great kitchen, and the best cooking stuff, he doesn't even cook",neutral,0
 He's a great guy and I think the world of him,happy,0
" Ok, I've said enough",neutral,0
 I need to figure what I'm going to throw out so I can move that desk from the middle of the dining room to one of the 2 rooms upstairs I occupy,neutral,0
" I had ""Stars Don't Shine"" stuck in my head earlier, and started singing it aloud to try and figure out what song it was, until I realized, too late, that it was Paris Hilton",neutral,0
 Our emotions are a gift from God,neutral,0
 But in order to recieve the blessing we must first realize that our emotions are always connected to a need being met or unmet,neutral,0
 By listening to our emotions and asking ourselves why we are feeling a particular emotion we can discover an unmet need or a need that has been satisfied,neutral,0
" For instance, if I feel sad because I have not seen my family in a long time my need for connection has not been met",sad,0
" On the otherhand, if I feel happy because I have spent time with my family then my need for connection has been met",happy,0
" How many times have we felt angry and as a result insulted, judged, criticized, blamed or physically hurt someone?",angry,0
 Probably too many to count,neutral,0
 We live in a society that has encourages us to stuff our emotions and a society that is by the most part feelings illiterate,sad,0
" So, what can we do?",neutral,0
" Well, for starters become aware of what we are feeling",neutral,0
 We can become conscious of what is going on inside us,neutral,0
 Once we put our finger on the emotion we are feeling we can then go on to vocalize it,neutral,0
" Marshall Rosenberg, author of Nonviolent Communication, has a four-step process for communication that incorporates identifying our feelings and needs into the model",neutral,0
" Part of that model involves asking the question, ""I am feeling _______ because I am needing ______",neutral,0
" Rosenberg also calls this four step process ""giraffe language",neutral,0
 He coined it giraffe language because the giraffe has the largest heart of all the mammals,neutral,0
 The heart is about 3 feet long and 3 inches thick all around,neutral,0
" The idea is that Nonviolent communication, which focuses on feelings and needs is the language of the heart because it focuses on what is alive in the heart",neutral,0
 By stating our feelings and needs to others we avoid blaming and criticizing them,angry,0
 We can then go on to making a request instead of a demand to help ourselves satisfy our now recognized need,neutral,0
 When others are angry or upset with us we can also use this technique on them,angry,0
" We can ask them, ""Are you feeling ______ because you are needing _______?""",neutral,0
 If we are not correct they will correct us and we will be closer to identifying the need they have and finding a way to resolve the situation,neutral,0
 By satisfying our needs and the needs of others we can reach a fair negotiation,neutral,0
 We can make a list of these feelings and be on the look out for them,neutral,0
 It may be that we need to take a timeout when we feel these feelings to avoid a conflict,neutral,0
" For instance, if we feel furious it may be better to take a one hour timeout and calm down",angry,0
" Then when we are calm, focus on sharing our feelings and needs with others",neutral,0
 Many times in the past we have reacted like a lion when we feel angry or frustrated with others or ourselves,angry,0
 Taking time to focus on our feelings and needs helps us not let the lion out and speak from the heart that language of the giraffe with ourselves and others,neutral,0

 I didn't go with my parents to Grandma's,neutral,0

 I'm losing enjoyment out of things I love to do and thats never a good sign,sad,0
 But oh well,neutral,0
 I don't even feel like doing anything right now and I'm having force myself to update this journal,neutral,0

 T_T eheh,neutral,0
 Though I was allowed to stay up until 1 AM last night,neutral,0
" But heh, thats basically it",neutral,0
 Theres nothing left to say so this is the end of my journal entry,neutral,0
 Well short one anyway,neutral,0
 This is my update for today and I am off,neutral,0
" It's yet another white man insensitivity subject that even has socialists and revolutionaries saying 'hey, hold on a second!'",neutral,0
 It's the veils,neutral,0
" Yes, the veils that many Muslim women around the world traditionally wear",neutral,0
" I'm not going to get into the wrongs and rights, just to give a bit of perspective",neutral,0
 Listen,neutral,0
 I see the words veil and headscarf being used by white Europeans in many contradictory contexts,neutral,0
 Let's clarify,neutral,0
 Hijab is a headscarf that covers the hair and usually wraps around the neck,neutral,0
" The veil is often interpreted as being the ninja outfit, where womens heads are completely covered so as to see only the eyes, or in some cases nothing at all",neutral,0
 Taleban style if you will,neutral,0
 This is called the nikab,neutral,0
 For clarification the difference should be noted,neutral,0
 Hijab in Islam actually means modesty or privacy,neutral,0
 And it is believed that women should practice modesty both for themselves but to keep the gazing eyes of man down,neutral,0
 The khimar is the actual headscarf,neutral,0
 The veil that covers the entire face is called the nikab,neutral,0
" Islam requires women to be modest, henceforth many of them wear the hijab, or headscarf",neutral,0
" The nikab, or taliban style cover, is not an Islamic practice",neutral,0
" A Fatwa, or Islamic legal pronouncement makes it clear that women are not obliged to wear nikab - but rather this is a cultural issue within more conservative or radical interpretations of Islam (just like the west has some Christian right wackies)",neutral,0
 It most certainly raised even more anti-Muslim sentiment but also more anti-French sentiment even amongst it own non-Christian communities,angry,0
" Whether the French will ever admit it or not, they have a serious racism problem - and its aimed mainly at Muslims and Africans",neutral,0
" The Germans have passed similar laws, much to the dismay of its large Turkish-Muslim population",sad,0
" The Brits, famous for their true melting pot status amongst the Europeans, have began treading in this murky water",neutral,0
" Jack Straw is calling for a ban of veils, or nikabs, in the UK",neutral,0
 Not the ban on hijabs,neutral,0
" The well integrated, but edgy Muslim community is not so happy about this",angry,0
 And I'm afraid it could get ugly,fear,0
 But if the UK Muslims are listening to Mr,neutral,0
 He clearly stated that he feels the veils should go -- but that it should be over a period of time and from within the Muslim community,neutral,0
" It shouldn't, he added, be decided by a group of old white male politicians",neutral,0
 Not to mention that many Muslim women scholars are saying women should thank Jack Straw for this,neutral,0
 I'm by no means an expert on veils,neutral,0
" What i do know is that there are many, many woman who absolutely voluntarily and willingly cover themselves with a headscarf for religious purposes",neutral,0
 Most of the European peasantry covered themselves with a headscarf just a hundred years ago and can still be found in christian villages throughout eastern and southern europe,neutral,0
 It is also true that many Muslim cultures in the world 'oblige' their women to wear the veil,neutral,0
 So the voluntary and involuntary,neutral,0
" France says no head scarves, no nothing -- look like a sexy french school girl with your belly button hanging out",neutral,0
" The Brits haven't ventured that far, they accept the head scarf, but oppose the ninja turtle look",neutral,0
 Turkey has a similar issue,neutral,0
" In its bid to become a secular society -- and to integrate into the unwelcoming arms of the European Union, it has forbidden even the nikab and in some places even the hijab in public schools and universities",neutral,0
 Sarajevo now has a large female Turkish population coming to study here so they can wear what they wish,neutral,0
" It is Europe's largest 'indigenous' Muslim population, all of whom are white Europeans and embrace European principles",neutral,0
" Bosnian Islam is very secular, and indeed seen by most European leaders as a model example of the type of Islam they want being taught in their increasing number of mosques and madressa's within the EU",neutral,0
 The question of hijab and nikabs hasn't come up yet here in Bosnia,neutral,0
" The hijab is accepted and tolerated, as are the nikab wearers (which is an extremely small percentage of Muslim women)",neutral,0
 The progressive west is certainly faltering when it comes to questions of its growing Muslim populations and addressing the cultural and religious difference between east and west,neutral,0
 The Muslims too have yet to seriously address the fears and concerns of 'indigenous' white westerners - who have opened their doors from some of the worlds worst economically and socially oppressed societies,fear,0
 This door has to swing both ways,neutral,0
" The west must do more to grasp the concepts of Islam - and understand the vast cultural differences even with the large and diverse Muslim community, which covers three continents",neutral,0
 Muslims too need to understand the fears and concerns of secular westerners who now have to deal with strict Islamic rules within their own communities,fear,0
" If western women can run around half naked, can eastern women completely cover themselves?",neutral,0
 Is there really a difference?,neutral,0
 There is no black and white my friends,neutral,0
 We all need to take the veils off,neutral,0
 and look at each other eye to eye,neutral,0
" Brother to brother, face to face, let's unite the human race",neutral,0
 I'm EXTREMELY sad to say that it looks as though The Skyline Obscura will be on an indefinate hiatus as of this past Thursday,sad,0
" Essentially, Christian is toggling with what direction, musically, he wants to pursue (whether that be skyline or not), whereas in light of the confustion, I (Mike) have decided to leave the project",neutral,0
" It was not on any bad terms, and to be honest, I don't know if there still is a Skyline to speak of, but as those of you who know US know that I'm pretty focused and content with where I am heading, and I've definately got my own timetable in which I plan to do it",neutral,0
" With that, some of the new songs that never were will be posted shortly for those of you who want to hear it",neutral,0
" Sorry for the letdown, and I can't speak for everyone else, but I'd rather have this happen now than later",sad,0
 Feel free to contact any of us individually about this if you feel so compelled as nobody's really going to be monitoring this site any more,neutral,0

" Well, my MIL arrived yesterday",neutral,0
" The one bad thing is that she got news this morning that her 21 y/o kitty, Aunt Becky, passed away last night",sad,0
" She knew the kitty was not doing well (she hasn't been for a while now, but kept rallying), so it wasn't a shock at all, but still sad",sad,0
" She had been looking at having to have her PTS before she leaves for Africa, but I guess Aunt Becky had other ideas",neutral,0
 I think Aunt Becky was waiting for my MIL to leave yesterday for her trip here,neutral,0
 Aunt Becky was sent over the bridge in a traditional Anishinaabe (Ojibwe/Chippewa) ceremony,neutral,0
" Aagii, my MIL's neighbor, is of the Bear Clan and is very traditional in her ways",neutral,0
 She wrapped Aunt Becky in ceremonial cloth with 4 different herbs and buried her down by the creek that runs behind their homes in Topanga Canyon,neutral,0
" My SIL and niece came over yesterday afternoon to collect our great-nephew, Brandon",neutral,0

" Besides from that random addition by my kooky self I hope you know what I'm trying to get at, because I know for me, that's how it is",neutral,0
 Okay that's about it for now,neutral,0
" First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of myself",happy,0
" What I completed in one day today, was not possible to me last week",neutral,0
" Today, I can say I actually taught for all three of my periods",neutral,0
 I walked into my first period only to find a sub,neutral,0
 I decided then and there that I would take advantage of the situation and teach the class,neutral,0
" I asked the sub if he did not mind my taking over, and of course he complied",neutral,0
" I figured I knew the material more than he did, and more importantly I knew the students and how the class should run",neutral,0
" So the bell rang, the sub introduced himself and I took over",neutral,0
" I had them write in their journals for a few minutes, then proceeded to facilitate the day's assignments",neutral,0
 I allowed them 10-15 minutes to finish up the work from yesterday before we began a new piece of literature,neutral,0
" After they turned that in, I introduced ""Poor Richard's Almanac,"" which we read as a class",neutral,0
 This was a very short reading so I gave the class an assignment to go along with the reading,neutral,0
 They had the remainder of the class to complete the assignment while I went around to monitor their work and answer questions,neutral,0
 The period ran smoothly under my direction most suprisingly to me,surprise,0
" On the other hand, I did know that today I was to teach a full period lesson to my freshmen for periods 3 &amp; 6",neutral,0
" For today's lesson I taught them how to determine the mood in a piece of literature based on the definition, an example, and a story out of their literature books",neutral,0
" I began my lesson by explaining what the term ""mood"" meant",neutral,0
" I explained to them that the ""mood"" of the story could be determined based on the word choice used by the author",neutral,0
" To give them a better understanding of how ""mood"" works, I presented them with a paragraph that I wrote on the overhead",neutral,0
 I had them follow along as I read out loud,neutral,0
" After I was done reading my paragraph, I had the students tell me what was the mood I had created",neutral,0
" Almost everyone participated, and for every type of mood they came up with, I had them point out places in the paragraph that helped them to determine the mood",neutral,0
 That was a segway into today's story,neutral,0
" Today we read, ""The Talk"" by Gary Soto",neutral,0
 I gave a brief background on the author and the story before we began,neutral,0
" I read the first paragraph, then I drew names out of my little tin container to complete the reading",neutral,0
" After certain spots, I would have them go over plot summary just to make sure they were following along",neutral,0
" At the end of the story, I had them do the same thing they did with my paragraph to determine the mood",neutral,0
" After a discussion, I asked them to take out a piece of paper",neutral,0
" I had them answer a question along the lines of, ""how would the mood of the story have been different if Soto wrote this as a child?""",neutral,0
" They answered on their papers, then shared out as a class",neutral,0
 This completed my very first lesson for periods 3 &amp; 6,neutral,0
" Wow, I hardly ever have plans",surprise,0
" I went to the OVAC volleyball tournament this morning, and was gone almost all day, and I'm going skating with one of my friends tonight",neutral,0

 And after reading Stephenie's story about how real her characters are,neutral,0
" how they can ""take over"" her outlines",neutral,0
 mine pretty much are bland,sad,0
" The story leads me, not the people who grace the page",neutral,0
 And Stephenie says that we should know our characters,neutral,0

 I have only had one bad experience on Ebay so far,sad,0
 One cookie jar was not packed well,neutral,0

" HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT PACKING, he said",neutral,0
" Well, needless to say his packing job was far below any I have seen so far",neutral,0
" To make a long story short, he told me I must have wanted this ugly old hen to match my personality",neutral,0
 I told him he was a f----ing a--hole and gave him a negative rating,angry,0
 He in turn gave me a negative rating,angry,0
 Man,neutral,0
 It really was his fault though,neutral,0
 And because I am such a perfectionist the negative rating had me bummed for awhile but now I am better,sad,0
 I even sold a few things on Ebay,neutral,0
 I sold an electric blanket for more than I paid for it,neutral,0
 I see Frankie at the junkyard has several electric blankets,neutral,0
 I can probably pick them up for less than a buck and sell them for lots lots more as long as they work,neutral,0
 Will have to work on that enterprise,neutral,0
 Tim and I have been fishing and camping,neutral,0
 We have been staying pretty close to home but still having a good time,happy,0

" Then they were cutting this damn tree down, and they made me go with then by dragging me over since I didn't want to go, and when I tried to sneak away",angry,0

" But my beloved G, who usually just prescribes stuff for me over the phone, starts throwing around words like ""orthopedic,"" ""surgery,"" and ""x-rays"" and I start thinking, ""oh shit!""",disgust,0
" Of course once he says the magic words (""degenerative arthritis"" and ""not uncommon AT MY AGE"") I do a total brain freeze and hear pretty much nothing afterwards",neutral,0

 Then they throw a little hissy fit for 5 minutes as I repeat myself over and over,angry,0
 And then they hang up,neutral,0
 And then I get an equally obnoxious call,angry,0
 Or some woman will call with a question that has nothing to do with circulation,neutral,0

 So,neutral,0
" I ask Robbye, knowledge of all things Ann Arbor News",neutral,0

 I went to Sheldon's house,neutral,0
 We sat outside on his porch,neutral,0
" Sheldon, Phil, Daniel, and I",neutral,0
" Talking about running into ongoing traffic and killing himself, and doing weed",angry,0
 Sheldon and I told him to shut up,angry,0
 He got up and said he doesn't have to take this from us and was especially angry at me,angry,0
 I tried to control myself,neutral,0
 He was so good-looking,happy,0
" His hair, his eyes, his dimples",neutral,0
 He has a new eye brow piercing,neutral,0
 It suits him,neutral,0
" Words like that made me and Phil stop smiling, look straight at Sheldon, and say ""shut up"" at the same time",angry,0
 It's still too soon to make those comments,neutral,0
" Hell, NEVER make them",angry,0
 But he did,neutral,0
 Because he knew I needed the reaction,neutral,0
 A couple of times Sheldon would say things to him and he would get angry and tell him to shut up,angry,0
" And really, he kind of did",neutral,0
 haha,happy,0
 I let him slip,neutral,0
 Phil reluctantly came along,neutral,0
" He didn't want to make eye contact with me, but we made eye contact a lot",neutral,0
" It was brief, and every single time, we would smile",happy,0
 But I didn't hug him,neutral,0
 And I didn't try to touch him,neutral,0
 I didn't want to make physicaly contact,neutral,0
 The whole way there he was grabbing onto poles and screaming like a banshee and his friend Johnny (who came along) got a swift punch in the nuts from Phil,angry,0
" I asked Phil, ""what the hell are you doing?"" and he looked angrily at me",angry,0
 Was I wrong to be taken aback by that?!,surprise,0
 No,neutral,0
" Then when we were there, I got what I needed, as did they, and I was standing outside with Phil as the other two were still in there",neutral,0
" I started talking to him about why he was so mad, and he said ""you called me retarded"", and I explained that he was being a prick",angry,0
" And he said that since he started drugs, he's a prick",angry,0
 And that it's him now,neutral,0
 I told him that's not true,neutral,0
" He ""whatever""ed me",angry,0
" I told him he didn't lose me, and he just looked at me and didn't say a word",neutral,0
" I assured him, ""you do care",neutral,0
 You just don't show it anymore,neutral,0
" and by then, they guys were out of the store",neutral,0
 Phil walked away quickly,neutral,0

 The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me,sad,0
 The worst part is- I love him,sad,0
 I love him with every ounce of everything that I am- but try as I might- we just cant' get it together,sad,0
 It's not over,neutral,0
 We're still together- and we still have the opportunity to make things right - - - but I'm a very patient person- and it's been close to 5 years now- and my patience is wearing thin,sad,0
 Something has to happen SOON,neutral,0
 I would like to be married before I'm 23,neutral,0
" Yes, we are having a small celebration today",happy,0
 Wayne just called me!!!!!!!!,neutral,0
 I am always so happy after talking to him!,happy,0
" Anyway, he said that since he (and all of the troop) are having to stay 16 months, they are getting to come home for 5 whole days for leave after they are done with their training (and before they go to thier permanent post)",neutral,0
" Apparently, it was not Wayne alone who was misled",neutral,0
 The rest of the troop that he was sent with thought they were only going for 12 months,neutral,0
 So they thought they were going for 12 and Wayne thought he was going for 10 and then one day BOOM they are staying for 16,surprise,0
 And every sigle one of them are furious,angry,0
 Wayne says that the tension is unreal,angry,0
 So they are getting to come home for a short time after thier training,neutral,0
" Now, they don't know yet when that will be, but I don't care",neutral,0
 I will get that 5 days and then later on he will still get RnR,neutral,0
" That was the first thing that I thought ""will that cut down yalls RnR?"" and he said no",neutral,0
 It is just something they get to do because they are having to go longer than intended or however they word that!,neutral,0
 Alley still hasn't had those pups,neutral,0
" I told her that she better get on the ball and she looked at me and yawned so maybe that was a yes, lol",happy,0
 I hope that she has them tonight,neutral,0
 If not I may have to get her a shot to induce labor,neutral,0
 It has been 4 days since her milk dropped and they are supposed to have the pups after 5,neutral,0
 We'll see,neutral,0
" That was one of the first things that Wayne wanted to know ""hows alley, has she had the pups"" I think he loves those dogs as much as me! I'll never forget the first tail that he docked by himself (it was Tuff's tail)",happy,0
 I was so proud,happy,0
 Keep in mind that we had only just moved in together at that time and he didn't know much about whelping pups!,neutral,0
 He had watched me dock two litters but still he did a great job,happy,0
" Now, he wishes that he was here to help with this litter Image",neutral,0
 But I am still SOOOOO excited that I'll get to see him for 5 days!!!!!!!!,happy,0

 I must say this summer has gone by in the blink of an eye,surprise,0
" what seemed like 4 months off, has seemed like it at all",neutral,0
 not that I had 4 months off in the end,neutral,0
" So far I have done zip camping, no trips to the lake",neutral,0
 I have been quite preoccupied though so I can't blame my lack of summer fun on laziness,neutral,0
 I  am getting so tired of this studying for my securities exam,neutral,0
 just once I would love to not have to worry about that sort of thing,happy,0
 and to have more than 2 weeks of vacation time,neutral,0
 but this is life and we must not forget that like is not a holiday,neutral,0
 I go for my practicum interview next week along with a 2 day orientation at PI,neutral,0
 Should be interesting,happy,0
 At least that is one issue that has finally gotten rolliing,neutral,0
 I was beginning to worry I'de have to put it off for yet another term,fear,0
 I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times,neutral,0
" I have been so focused on this course and going to work with my dad, that I really don't know what to think anymore",neutral,0

 hey I'll be a rich individual,happy,0
 whoot,happy,0
 I'm really in it just for the money ;),happy,0
 actually I just want to give the opportunity a chance,neutral,0
 I have nothing to lose,neutral,0
" I still will have my degree to back me up and I true desire to go into law enforcement, but for now I want to do this",neutral,0
 it  gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now,neutral,0
 Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it,neutral,0
 Worry gains you no more minutes to  your life,fear,0
 rather it steals what precious ones you have left,neutral,0
 and stress,sad,0
 we have no one to blame but our selves,neutral,0
 society has become just one big stress pool,sad,0
" Our conversations with family, friends, co-workers etc",disgust,0
 where I am going with this I have no clue,neutral,0
" I don't have a plan, I don't know what I want in the long run",neutral,0
 I'm just taking it as it comes,neutral,0
" one day, one week at a time",neutral,0
" I love my family unconditionally, and cherish every moment with them, even my eldest sister, who pushes me over the edge, but I have developed a certain method inwhich to deal with it",happy,0
" I have to look at life in her perspective, and it would break anyones heart",sad,0
" To have something inside of you that you cannot control, something foreign that has stolen away your chance of a normal life",sad,0
" being alienated, being alone",sad,0
" I can only take so much of her though, for her sake and mine :)",neutral,0
" I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life",surprise,0
 but they make my time at work memorable,happy,0
 one I am not thinking long term,neutral,0
" I have put my life in the hands of god, and left him to it",neutral,0
" I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship",happy,0
 I frankly would be just as happy alone,happy,0
 maybe more so,neutral,0
 I needed to start over new,neutral,0
 They are better off where they are now,neutral,0
 we are all moving forward on our own path,neutral,0
 hopefully the right one,neutral,0
" Still there is so much more to learn, and my life is but young",neutral,0
" I have a list of things I want to do during my time, and each day I add something new to it",neutral,0
" lol, lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it",happy,0
 anyway I heard this while I was in church and it really grabbed my interest,neutral,0
" it says a lot, even if it was written by a comedian",neutral,0
" A few days ago, I ran into this article online: http://msnbc.com/id/14126192/ talking about statistics regarding the number of friends people having being at some sort of new low",neutral,0
" I guess I fit the group the article refers to, in regards to having only 2 or 3 friends that would fall into the ""support mechanism"" category, if only because of circumstantial or geographical factors being taken into consideration as well",neutral,0
" One of those 3 will be moving this fall, and the others have an awful lot going on in their lives, in addition to being less available than the first by a long shot anyhow",sad,0
" On a larger scale, this really makes me think about the way that I've cultivated my friendships, and the way I've maintained them as well",neutral,0
" I definitely feel like, moreso than any other time in my life, I'm operating almost at the ground floor in regards to the friendships I have and the way I interact with those friends",neutral,0
" I've burned a lot of bridges and engaged in decisions which have hampered my ability to be trusted as much as I'd like to be by some of my friends, and likewise, there have been things which have altered my ability to fully engage some people as well, be they circumstacial or environmental or whatever",sad,0
" Suffice to say that there are a fair amount of people out there whom I would count among my friends, but limited few whom I would count as good friends, due to actions both inside and outside of my role in that friendship",neutral,0
" We're getting older, we have a lot more work-related matters and our personal lives can get pretty complicated",neutral,0
" You build friendships as fortifications against getting too old too fast, but sometimes life just catches up with you regardless of your efforts",neutral,0
" On a ""big picture"" scale, I'd like to believe that I still hold the same value system that I held when I was 18 years old, now a scary half-a-lifetime ago",fear,0
" All in all, I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that's what keeps you going, isn't it?",angry,0
" If I didn't have the desire to be better than what I currently am, would I have impetus to keep living at all?",neutral,0
 I hope not,neutral,0
" As far as ""support mechanisms"" go, I've seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach",neutral,0
" Home may be where you hang your hat, but happiness is sometimes found far from home or in the last place you'd even expect to look for it",happy,0
" I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other (some of the time, at least",happy,0
 It goes back to that whole journey vs,happy,0
" if the goals are similar, which one would you prefer to be?",neutral,0
 Now which one are you most of the time?,neutral,0
" Friendship works the same way- some people only appreciate friendships which are productive and goal-oriented, whereas there are also friendships that meander along the way, and each moment can be as interesting and rewarding as the ones before and after",happy,0
" It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you, especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful",neutral,0
 I know I'm guilty of that all the time,sad,0
 Often we fail to realize what we've lost until something becomes too distant and difficult to regain,sad,0
" Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened",sad,0
" It sucks, and it takes effort to keep a swerving friendship from heading down these sort of paths, but the effort far outweighs the consequences of failing to do so",disgust,0
 So what does this mean to me then?,neutral,0
 It means I have some tough choices to make,neutral,0
" I can only change my own mind, so whatever efforts I expend have to be met with some sort of equal efforts or the process goes nowhere and frustrates me the entire way",disgust,0
" Is it worth it, or is it better to just let fate play out its' hand and look for a new deal?",neutral,0
 There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless,neutral,0
" I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it's not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried",neutral,0
" If being a friend isn't about trying, then I've been taking the wrong approach all along",neutral,0
" As of late, it seems that everything my parents do, they do it just to annoy me",angry,0
 I love them,happy,0
 GOD are they annoying me,angry,0
" I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears",angry,0
 I was thinking about our most recent spat today at dinner and wondering why the hell everything turns out this way,angry,0
 My only plausible explanation is that I want out,neutral,0
" No matter how much I love them, I want to be independent and living on my own, providing for myself and on the road to success",neutral,0
" Now, I know that I will reach this place soon enough, but damn it feels like it is taking forever",angry,0
" I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free",neutral,0
 Frenchie Fucked Off,disgust,0
 Now me and Tyler are running the shop and I don't know if Tyler's even going to stay or not,neutral,0
" Lots of angry costomers with half finished work, a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business",angry,0
" Oh yeah, and the best part:",neutral,0
" My gun, my nozzles, my power supply, my footpedal",neutral,0
 It's been a week and I'm still really pissed off,angry,0
" I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues (errors on pages) and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday!!",angry,0
" Further to that by the way, I did speak to him about it further when he said ""My new food is making me feel really healthy"" - yes considering he'd eated two meals of it, and then gone out to dinner, and Friday was going out to lunch with a friend",happy,0
" He's paying $250 a week to eat food, and then eat again",neutral,0
" But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time",surprise,0
 The look on my face I think said it all,surprise,0
" This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1",surprise,0
" ""I choose to do more important things with my time",neutral,0
" Let me see - golf, sitting on a beach drinking coffee, bitching about money, being a complete elitest snob",disgust,0
 great life choices right there,disgust,0
 no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough,neutral,0
 Urgh,disgust,0
" I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy ""I don't have to do anything"" option",angry,0
" If I could afford the food, I would probably do it myself, but Jenny Craig was expensive enough, and that was $100 a week, not $250, and I didn't have a mortgage then",neutral,0
" But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy",disgust,0
 He could EASILY cook his own food - his kitchen probably cost more than half my house,neutral,0
 AARRGGHH!!!,angry,0
" Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him",angry,0
" She slams on her brakes, stops her car, right in front of me, in the middle of the street, and gets out",angry,0
 Then she comes up to me and starts yelling at me,angry,0
" ""YOU LIKE ALMOST HIT ME OMG",angry,0
 I said,neutral,0
" I'm not very nice, not when facing death",angry,0
" ""OMFG if there is like damage",angry,0
" "" She threatened",angry,0
" I must admit, I was kind of fascinated by the way her eyes, rimmed in black eyeliner, managed to stay so wide open like that",surprise,0
 It went on like that for a good minute,neutral,0
 Finally I got fed up,disgust,0
 I tried to bike away- what was she gonna do?,neutral,0
 Write down my licensce plate?,neutral,0
 THis was when the Princess turned into some sort of psychobitch from hell,disgust,0
 I guess someone forgot her midol,neutral,0
" She grabbed the handlebars of my bike, and tried to push me off",angry,0
" Now, people are already honking and stuff because her daddy's lexus is blocking the intersection",angry,0
 We're struggling with my bike,neutral,0
 I got mad,angry,0
" Now, when one says you, ""hit like a girl"" take it as a compliment",neutral,0
 I hit that bitch so hard,angry,0
" hey, she assulted me",angry,0
 and I was on a fucking BIKE,angry,0
 fucking A,angry,0
 must have been a dye job gone HELLA bad,angry,0
 And I found out in the most annoying way,disgust,0
" I woke up on Wednesday morning, bright and early (as I do) to go into work/uni",neutral,0
 I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on,surprise,0
" Now I thought at first that maybe it had broken the night before, after I'd gone to bed or something",neutral,0
" But then one of my housemates, who was already up, informed me that no, it was that the electricity wasn't working anywhere in the house",neutral,0
" Trying to turn it back on only got me another automatic trip as lights flashed on for a brief moment, and then suddenly back off",neutral,0
" Grrrr - I then spent the next 10 minutes or so turning everything off in the house, switching the safety switch back on, and then sequentially turning everything back on until the safety was tripped",angry,0
 We tried everything to make sure it wasn't the plug/circuit itself,neutral,0
" But no, it was the fridge",neutral,0
" We thought for a while about what to do, not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one",neutral,0
" At first one of my housemates thought about possibly buying a new fridge for themselves, but that idea was sadly left behind due to monetary issues",sad,0
 In then end my other housemate's lovely girlfriend (love you heaps babes!),happy,0
 offered to give us her fridge (woooo!),happy,0
" So, we've now gone over 48 hours without a fridge (hate to think what half our food is like in there!)",disgust,0
 but will joyfully be picking the other one up today,happy,0
 Wooo!,happy,0
 In other news I have 6 days to go (including today) before I leave!,neutral,0
 YAY!,happy,0
" As we wrote in a recent posting, even in a favorable political climate Democratic candidates face a significant challenge in turning out their base voters",neutral,0
" Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far (at least in Harris County) of a groundswell to actually vote in November",angry,0
" An oft-repeated notion in recent weeks, however, has been that this year Republicans too will have a difficult time turning out their party faithful on November 7th",neutral,0
" The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W",angry,0
" Well, maybe",neutral,0
" As noted in the latest issue of US News &amp; World Report, new polling has Republican insiders feeling pretty darn good about turning out their folks this fall, with confidence that they will vote to return their party's elected officials to power",happy,0
" The article cites a recent strategic memo to national GOP Party Chair Ken Mehlman from Market Strategies, which highlights polling (granted, six-week old polling) showing the base is in line and ready to hit the polls",neutral,0
 Is this spin or is it true?,neutral,0
" Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly",neutral,0
" In other words, the mantra for Democratic candidates this political season: persuade everyone you can, turn out your base, and assume all the other guy's usual folks will vote",neutral,0
" In other words Democrats, work like hell until November 7th",neutral,0

 We had a good lunch with Gino Genelli ice-cream!,happy,0
" (However you spell the Genelli part) Ah, we talked about Anri's ex and her mom mentioned how Anri was angry with her dad the one time the ex visited, cos her dad kept him busy most of the day",angry,0
 Oh ya we were talking about Land Rovers!,neutral,0
 Anyhow her dad asked her then at the table but why would you be angry with your dad,angry,0
" ""Whahahaha"" I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush",happy,0
 W0rd!,neutral,0
 That was funny,happy,0
 Everyone at the table was giggeling,happy,0
 W0rd I am dead tired!,neutral,0
 Gonna push through with this!,neutral,0
" Then Anri wanted to go the beach, cos she just visited for the weekend and has to go back to where she studies in another suburb like hunderds of km's away from the ocean",neutral,0

 Now that was fun,happy,0
 Will try and upload them somewhere or do something or I will see!,neutral,0
 Okies!,neutral,0
 I took photo's of this little girl swimming in the ocean,neutral,0
 The water is freezing cold by the way and it is winter and we sat there dressed warmly!,neutral,0
 Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves,neutral,0
 You know that Baywatch running style from that tv program,neutral,0
 Funny photo's came out there,happy,0
" I wanted to take photo's of Kiteboarders, but there were none!",neutral,0
 Just guys flying their kites,neutral,0
 =/ And some guy on a prepelled engine driven kite thing that was in the air,neutral,0
 o,neutral,0
" I would like to just walk around or sit somewhere where lotsa people are and take photo's of them, especially like action photo's!",neutral,0
 LOVE IT!,happy,0
 It is like doing my art,neutral,0
 I get lost in it,neutral,0
 I totally zone out,neutral,0
 We went to Anri's house for cake and coffee,neutral,0
 Hmmm,neutral,0
 cake ^,happy,0
 Coffeee and dark chocolate!,happy,0
 Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what,neutral,0
 We sat there 'trying to decide' what we are going to do,neutral,0
 We almost sat there for an hour,neutral,0
 Lizelle didn't want to go to church,neutral,0
 That was as clear as daylight,neutral,0
 So we basicly had to wait for Anri to decide,neutral,0
 Hm,neutral,0
 Really sad how we can actually sit and wonder in your one hand is God and the other hand is a movie,sad,0
 what do you pick,neutral,0
" (Non-christians, don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts, doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person, just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me",neutral,0
 so we went and it was nice to be there!,happy,0
 :p,neutral,0
 They went to the movies afterwards,neutral,0
 Anri promised to come to my house after the movie to keep me awake while I work,neutral,0
" Didn't think she would do it, but hey!",surprise,0
 I sat there drawing and uhm the phone rang and it was the police,neutral,0
 Ye,neutral,0
 I am too tired now,neutral,0
 will finish later,neutral,0
 I want to pose a serious question to anyone out there that chooses to read this,neutral,0
" If you were given the choice between life and death, which one would you choose?",neutral,0
" No, I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering",disgust,0
 The choice does seem quite  obvious to me,neutral,0
 Would you be careful and try to preserve every moment you have left?,neutral,0
" I have a friend that is gonna die, probably sooner than later, and I was  angry because some of the choices he has made in the last few years have cut his time down to virtually nothing",angry,0
 So I tried to step out of myself for a minute and look at things the way he may have been viewing them,neutral,0
 Imagine you are young and healthy,neutral,0
 An athelete,neutral,0
 The whole world and it's endless possibilities are  stretched out before you,neutral,0
 You have wonderful friends that love and cherish you,happy,0
 You are virtually unstoppable,neutral,0
 All you have to do is decide which opportunity you would like to take advantage of first,neutral,0
 Then things start to take a turn in an unexpected direction,surprise,0
" Think constant arguing,  lies and deception, money mismanagement, and infidelity",angry,0
 So you decide to join the military,neutral,0
" You figure, 'Hey, I might as well use this opportunity to see the world, make some money, and get an education and a marketable skill",neutral,0
 The world is still yours for the taking,neutral,0
 So you make an appointment with a recruiter for an interview and physical,neutral,0
 Everything goes well with the interview,neutral,0
 The recruiter tells you that the technology field in which you are interested is growing rapidly and there are all types of jobs available that you can parlay into a lucrative career once you retire from the service,neutral,0
 You leave there with a renewed sense of purpose and vow to take full advantage of this experience,neutral,0
" You go home, wait two weeks, then return to the recruiter's office for the results of your background check and physical",neutral,0
 The recruiter comes in the office with a look of sadness and disappointment,sad,0
" You think to yourself that maybe you had too many traffic tickets, or maybe there was something small in your past that has presented you from being selected to join the military",neutral,0
 The look on the recruiter's face is unmistakable,neutral,0
 You begin to prepare yourself to hear bad news and immediately go into self preservation mode to plan out your next move,sad,0
" He begins to speak while you're planning, ""I'm sorry to have to tell you this(ok, I can move back home for a while and go back to school and work on my degree",sad,0
" ), but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forces(or I could do some traveling and explore the country",neutral,0
" We have the results from your physical(I know, I'm gonna do some volunteer work with kids in the community",neutral,0
 So what do you do?,neutral,0
" This is the story as it was given to me, and when I heard it I was pissed",disgust,0
" First, because I could already piece together the backdrop of the story",neutral,0
" See, I knew he had cheated",neutral,0
 lol),happy,0
 But he assured me that he had used a condom and that I was the only one that he was having unprotected sex with,neutral,0
 So imagine my surprise  when I was about to engage in activities with him and saw an of color coming from you know where,surprise,0
" She then tells me that she's gonna test me for gonorrhea, but also that she's gonna have to test me for HIV",neutral,0
" I'm like, ""For what?""",surprise,0
" She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea, what makes me think that person didn't have anything else?",neutral,0
 I couldn't answer her,neutral,0
" Really, what did make me think that?",surprise,0
" I would have given this man, who obviously had little regard for me, my life in exchange for his bullshit and lies",disgust,0
" Fortunately, my test results came back negative for both gonorrhea and HIV",happy,0
" I was of course thankful, but I realized something very important during that time",happy,0
 I realized that my life belongs to me,disgust,0
" The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking",angry,0
 He never went to see an infectious disease specialist,neutral,0
 He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin,neutral,0
" He partied just as hard as I did, drank and smoked just as much weed as me",neutral,0
" When we first became friends he was an athelete, so he was pretty fit for the most part",neutral,0
" I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics",neutral,0
 Maybe he maintained that lifestyle in the beginning because he thought that  he could somehow combat his illness this way,neutral,0
 I wonder what changed his mind about that?,surprise,0
" Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex?",neutral,0
" I've asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer",neutral,0
" But I think about it alot, and I wonder exactly when did he decide to die?",surprise,0
 I wonder how many other people have made the same decision that he made,neutral,0
 I wonder what choices I would have made differently had that nurse from the clinic given me different results,neutral,0
 So what would you do?,neutral,0
" Would you choose to live, or would you choose to die?",neutral,0
" The question itself is mostly rhetorical, presented to raise awareness and provoke thought moreso than response",neutral,0
" However, if you are so compelled to do so, please leave your thoughts and comments",neutral,0
 All will be greatly appreciated,neutral,0

 I've been thinking a great deal about the importance of ritual,neutral,0
" Not religious ritual (like baptism) or societal ritual (like shaking hands), but personal ritual",neutral,0
 I've been wondering which aspects of a behavior determine whether it's ritual or rut,neutral,0
 And how I can possibly develop more rituals and fewer ruts in my life,neutral,0
" This has all come about because lately, I've been thinking about the Big Picture",neutral,0
" Granted, not the global, world-issues Big Picture, just MY Big Picture",neutral,0
" The same thought keeps coming back to me: I lived my first 40 years largely as a leaf, blowing about in the wind",neutral,0
 Like that bag in American Beauty,neutral,0
 it was not self-determined,neutral,0
 I want the next 40 years to be lived on purpose,neutral,0
 How do I do that?,neutral,0
 And how can I start now?,neutral,0
" One of my most surprising observations about this whole ritual thing is how much easier it was to establish new rituals when I was on location, as opposed to being at home",surprise,0
" And, the corollary: how easy it is to slip into old habits, once back at home",neutral,0
 [It makes sense that there is concern for addicts or alcoholics who successfully gets straight or sober some place other than where they live,neutral,0
 and then eventually have to return home to old triggers,neutral,0
 So anyway,neutral,0
 Ritual,neutral,0
 Rut,neutral,0
" That, and they may not be exactly great for you",neutral,0
" I'm not advocating all-structure, all-the-time or anything",neutral,0
 But I do know the perils of a life devoid of ritual,fear,0
 At least in my experience,neutral,0
 I'd like to say that my rituals are more active and crunchy,neutral,0
" but alas, they aren't (yet)",sad,0
 Here are some rituals I HAVE managed to cultivate:,neutral,0
" * Every day when I come home from work, the first thing I do is put on my pajamas",neutral,0
 Maybe that doesn't sound like a ritual,neutral,0
" but when I started thinking about things I do regularly that I enjoy, that's definitely one of them",happy,0
" * Every other Saturday, Catharine and I get manicures and pedicures",neutral,0
" A time to relax, be pampered, catch up",neutral,0
 and we come away with the cutest toes ever!,neutral,0
 * A ritual I absolutely adore is going to the outdoor screenings at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery during the summer,happy,0
" There are all sorts of mini-rituals that go into this regular event, including the collection of picnic dinner items and the precision methodology by which one gets the perfect spot on the lawn",neutral,0
" * When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying",happy,0
" Maybe after this show ends, I'll be able to start a new garden",neutral,0
" I've just realized in trying to make a list of my rituals, that I really don't have many",neutral,0
 How very telling,neutral,0
 This is not good,sad,0
" When I imagine the rituals of others, things like a daily, morning run (something hard for me to fathom, I admit), meditation, feeding the ducks on Thursdays, after-dinner strolls with your family, poker night, date night",neutral,0
 and the like are what come to mind,neutral,0
" * I'm happy to taste any new flavor of ice cream (I love to try new flavors!), but when it comes to ordering, it's always Mint Chip",happy,0
 Always,neutral,0
 and,neutral,0
 * My fear of insomnia keeps me from going to bed when I'm really tired,fear,0
 Is that a rut,neutral,0
 or just something totally mental that I do?,neutral,0
" Anyway, I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts",neutral,0
 How do you think we can instill more meaningful rituals into our lives?,neutral,0
" ""The image of cartoonist after cartoonist sitting at folding tables selling comic books is truly a pathetic one",sad,0
" From talking with cartoonists, I get the sense that most of them find it debilitating, too",neutral,0
 It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything,sad,0
" - Bart Beaty, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at the show, from his Conversational Eurocomics column on what SPX could learn from some European conventions",happy,0
" I really enjoyed myself at SPX, that delightsome Bethesda megamall of rare and exclusive purchases and the men and women who brought the wares about",happy,0
" Don't sweat it, that's just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner (he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive), arrived a half-hour after the doors opened, stayed until 5:30, then went right back home",neutral,0
" That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards, didn't partake of any post-show gatherings, and missed a big chunk of panels",neutral,0
" My SPX, in other words, was full of shopping and stalking the aisles",neutral,0
 Commerce!,neutral,0
 Show debuts!,neutral,0
" I met an awful lot of fine creators, but I hated taking up much of their table time; heaven knows by the afternoon there's a swarm of people waiting to trudge through the byways between tables, and one thousand distractions to attend to",disgust,0
" I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator",neutral,0
" There were no signs to direct you to the panels or whatnot, though it wasn't hard to find someone to ask direction of",neutral,0
" Still, the separation-by-floor carried a certain symbolism for me when coupled with the atmosphere; upstairs was the carnival of monies and tables, downstairs were the talks and trophies",neutral,0
" Upstairs there were masses of shoppers with bags and backpacks and totes, cookies and candies and muffins on certain tables to attract attention, and even a pair of folks operating hand puppets to entice a stray passerby",neutral,0
" Downstairs there were hushed people crouched before open doors, the portals leading to capacity talks",neutral,0
" All of it in a building off the highway, malls and fences and the whipping metal sea of vehicles all around it",neutral,0
" To say there was no color at all would be misleading, since it was a nice day and there were a number of trees and things, but I did not detect any local pulse at all",neutral,0
" It was a hotel, on a road",neutral,0
" I went out for lunch with Chris and Gina Gagliano of First Second; food became curiously hard to find within hiking distance (in the interests of full disclosure, my mastery of direction also had us walking the wrong way for a good while)",neutral,0
" After we passed by a large parking lot promising a furniture blowout sale, as well as a haunted attraction and possibly ponies or something in the back, we decided to turn around and stop at a little diner we'd passed on the way",neutral,0
 But we didn't hang around,neutral,0
" We hurried back from the gray highway to the center of comics and people, followed close behind by haunted ponies who'd just bought cheap Barcaloungers for their ghost stable and were now jonesing for independent comics",neutral,0
" I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you",happy,0
" I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet, though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk",neutral,0
" I'm also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins",happy,0
" Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency (I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all); if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness",neutral,0
" A diverse audience too, everything from young to old, from old-school nerds to stylish-looking folk, from aged hippies to teenage Goths",neutral,0
" To look only at this crowd, you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience",neutral,0
" I went to two panels, Scott McCloud's and Brian Chippendale's",neutral,0
" There was nowhere to sit in the former, since I got there late, so I sort of drifted in and out of hearing distance",neutral,0
" At one point, McCloud began vigorously drawing a chart to illustrate different types of artists, all the while telling stories of the message board clashes between forces on places like the Comics Journal board",neutral,0
" Someone behind me turned to someone else and whispered ""It's just like Civil War",neutral,0
" Afterward (a solid half-hour afterward, I believe), McCloud could be seen out in the hallway, taking questions from anyone who happened to want to talk to him away from the bustle of his table upstairs",neutral,0
" The Chippendale talk was different, a highly entertaining, digression-prone ramble by the artist through his history and procedure, moderated by Dan Nadel and with extra bonus contributions from Brian Ralph, who was seated in the back of the room",happy,0
" Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around",neutral,0
 And I bought a good deal of stuff too,neutral,0
" I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn't quite hold",neutral,0
" I managed to get through the whole show without finding anything I really wanted sold out, however, and I only had to stand in the Line of Shame at the ATM once",neutral,0
 BOOKS I GOT:,neutral,0
" Abraxas and the Earthman by Rick Veitch (debuted at the show, a collection of the Epic Illustrated serial; an additional collection of Veitch's short comics from the same venue is coming soon)",neutral,0
" Awakening Comics #1-2 by Steve Peters &amp; friends (I reviewed his The Origin of Sparky a few weeks ago; having walked away from the table, and indeed the entire convention, I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten to actually tell Steve Peters who I was - another triumph of intellect!)",surprise,0
" Cinema Sewer #19 edited by Robin Bougie (new issue of the funny, comics-heavy pamphlet-format magazine devoted entirely to the finest in exploitation and pornographic film - a creator's personality-powered publication, and I assure you that Robin Bougie is in real life exactly the way he portrays himself in the mag)",neutral,0
" Cold Heat #1-2 (of 12) by Ben Jones &amp; Frank Santoro (#2 debuted at the show; the odd, semi-abstract fantasy/action book that Diamond initially disliked a while back, complaining of its format despite the fact that it's 100% a serialized pamphlet-format comic)",neutral,0
" Comics Comics #1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler &amp; Dan Nadel (I mentioned this yesterday, but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue #1)",neutral,0
 Ed the Happy Clown #2 (of 9) by Chester Brown (the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?!),neutral,0
" Fuzz &amp; Pluck in Splitsville #4 (of 5) by Ted Stearn (surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz &amp; Pluck; still, I've never seen this in a store, though Fantagraphics had it at their table)",neutral,0
" House of Twelve, at the movies Vol",neutral,0
" 2 #1: Heavy Metal by various (from House of Twelve, a free giveaway show debut, parodying the original movie version of the magazine)",neutral,0
" New Tales of Old Palomar #1 (of 3) by Gilbert Hernandez (new miniseries of stand-alone tales, presented in the Ignatz format, debuting at a show featuring the Ignatz Awards; I remember when this was first released I heard it was going to be titled simply 'New Palomar' like it was New X-Men)",neutral,0
" Ninja by Brian Chippendale (debuted at the show, probably the book of the show, and I've gushed enough already; when I went to Rick Veitch's table, he became momentarily transfixed with the transfixed and murmured ""I want to make a book like this!"")",neutral,0
" Paping #11 by various (older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though)",neutral,0

" But it was a good read, and if I did have a dream where I had sex with my mother, well, now I'd know what it means",happy,0
" Sometimes, I can't reading about this condition, though",neutral,0
 I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it,neutral,0
 I didn't always have this problem,neutral,0
 When I was a kid I slept,neutral,0

" But it's all good when folks need or want something, isn't it?",neutral,0
" And then one of them played a song that made me think of my mom, and suddenly, I'm so depressed that all I want to do is go curl up in a ball and die",sad,0
 And now the MAIN instigator in the house has come home,angry,0

 So,neutral,0
" This last week at school was nuts- it was the first time that I can remember where I was putting in the hours in the lab, really busting my ass- classes are going well and I feel like it all ties in- which I really like",angry,0
 It's nice kind of being able to put everything together in my head,neutral,0
" I'm sure by now most people heard about the really sad disappearance and murder of Michelle-Gardner Quinn, a UVM student",sad,0
 It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it,sad,0
 I found out about it on the way to Boston this weekend and I was just shocked,surprise,0
 I transferred from a school in an unsafe part of a city to UVM and found it to be much more laid back and free,neutral,0
 Even just this last week there is a definite change in atmosphere around these parts that is pretty sad,sad,0
 I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part,sad,0
" Anyways, I'm not sure there's anything else I can add that hasn't been said over and over",neutral,0
 It was so fun seeing everyone from way back- we ran into Eric and went out to see Michele so it was just so fun,happy,0
 Now I'm just trying to take everything one day at a time,neutral,0
 Work and school are getting a little intense but I've found that I can do it- I just need to stay focused,neutral,0
 My brother turns 16 on Wednesday (how),surprise,0

 Last week was so busy that I just TRASHED it,neutral,0
 It needs a serious pick up and vacuum,neutral,0
 My mom would be so proud of me,happy,0
" cold, rainy day",neutral,0
 no easy transition into this weather; it felt more like winter than fall up on the trail,neutral,0
 i took Shelby again,neutral,0
 i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning,surprise,0
 she was raring to go,neutral,0
" once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy, darting all over the place, picking up stones, randomly chewing on tree roots, etc",neutral,0
" back at the car, T had Shelby all wrapped up in a towel to warm her",neutral,0
 i was surprised to see her sitting so still; spastic switch must have been turned off,surprise,0
 T started off with Smiley; a 2-3 year-old shepard-pitbull mix,neutral,0
" he was a stray, found wandering Discovery Park",neutral,0
 he has a bad left eye which i don't think he has any vision,neutral,0
 i ran with Smiley this past Wednesday; he was just released (no one came to claim him) and allowed to go for a run,neutral,0
 during the run we were calling him Lance (since he was nameless) because when he was laying on his back in the grass he would kick his legs like he was riding a bike; i wrote this stuff down on his sheet but i guess the officer's didn't like the name,neutral,0
 Finally a picture update!,neutral,0

" Along the way, Christina, Kevan, Eff, and I played the alphabet game like in a gazillion different versions",neutral,0
" Two hours with Kevan, I should get credit for surviving that long with that nerd",neutral,0
 XD,neutral,0
 Then we met him,neutral,0
 Eff questions how the belt keeps up his pants,neutral,0
 I question that too,neutral,0
 I want to go here,neutral,0
 because they have a snazzy sign!,neutral,0
 This was after we finished a 6 mile walk,neutral,0
 Check out the look on Christina's face,neutral,0

 Interact ended up being a whole ton better than I had expected,neutral,0
" That's all for now, I have homework",neutral,0
" I stand barefoot by the ocean's edge, my feet sinking slowly, being sucked beneath the surface of the cool, wet sand",neutral,0
 I am planted there,neutral,0
 Head tilted back,neutral,0
" watching Mother Nature's lightshow, I see",neutral,0
" enormous mounds of gray cotton batting clouds, only momentarily visible as they are back-lit by silent, random flashbulbs",neutral,0
 The sand wrapping my feet is now warmer than the air,neutral,0
 I stretch my arms out as far as they will reach just as the first drum rolls of thunder pound my ears,neutral,0
" Slightly swaying with the breeze, I can feel the deep vibration moving through me.   and away",neutral,0
 Being the tallest object on the beach in a thunderstorm and living to write about it,neutral,0
 Well here we are again at the conclusion of another all too fleeting weekend,neutral,0
 Although my brother likes to point out the fact that every day for me is a weekend,neutral,0
" Regardless of my temporal status as far as my brother is concerned, time still moves ahead at a frighteningly rapid pace",fear,0
" Speaking of time, this morning amazon dot com and myself transacted some by business",neutral,0
 I ordered the first season of Doctor Who on DVD,neutral,0

 Once I have them all then I think I'll start on Blackadder,neutral,0
 I'm sorry but British television rules,neutral,0
" I spent the majority of the day up in Madison (hi Robby, I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is)",neutral,0
 Their historical society was having a century home tour as a fund raiser and my mother wanted to go,neutral,0
 I assumed that with my niece in New York and my sister working a weekend job to keep her there that it would just be my mother and I; little did I know that she invited my sister-in-law to accompany us,surprise,0
 Spending quality time with my sister-in-law is,neutral,0
" On the plus side, the home tour put me in the holiday spirit",happy,0
 This week I am totally going to start my Christmas shopping,happy,0
 I used to have it all done by Halloween so maybe I'll return to that tradition,neutral,0
 This coming week I intend to get serious about my real estate venture by establishing a revolving line of credit at the bank,neutral,0
" I am actively seeking foreclosures and other deals, however, if I find one I want to get the financing out of the way to allow me to move quickly",neutral,0
 It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90,neutral,0
" And on that note, enjoy the remainder of your Sunday",happy,0
" Well, we're half-way through our trip",neutral,0
 I can't believe it!,surprise,0
 It's amazing,happy,0
 Right now we're on a train traveling from Rome to Florence,neutral,0

 Wow,happy,0
" On Friday we saw the Coliseum, the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Palatine Hill, Villa Medici, Trinita dei Monti, Piazza del Popolo and much more",neutral,0
 There is a church or ruins everywhere you look,neutral,0
 The Coliseum (or Colosseo) was awesome,happy,0
 That it is still standing for us to see is,happy,0
 Amazing,happy,0
 Yesterday (Saturday) was spent at Vatican City,neutral,0
 To enter the Museums it was about a two hour wait,neutral,0
 The lines around the wall was insanely long,neutral,0
" In October the Museums close quite early (1:20pm), so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things",neutral,0
" I would have loved to see the Library, but we didn't get to it",neutral,0
 Ah well,neutral,0
" There was so much to look at, I just couldn't take it all in",neutral,0
 At all,neutral,0
 After eating a quick meal we walked around the outside of the wall trying to find St,neutral,0
 We walked around pretty much the entire city until we found it,neutral,0
" It was beautiful, and FULL of people and tour buses",happy,0
" Again, we stood in line to enter the church",neutral,0
" Didn't have to wait too long, though",neutral,0
 Inside was stunning- and FULL of people,surprise,0
 And then we realized- there was Mass going on!,surprise,0
 I can't believe they do that!,surprise,0
 It's so rude!,disgust,0
 Ah well,neutral,0
 Last night we met an Australian couple at our hostel and had a nice chat,happy,0
 You meet a lot of neat people at hostels,neutral,0
 It's pretty cool,happy,0
" So anyway, Rome in general was loud, dirty and absolutely chock-full of people and cars and bikes",disgust,0
 There is a pizzeria and gelateria on every corner,neutral,0
" The city really is like a human being, especially in the morning as you watch and hear it begin to awaken",neutral,0
" I've been trying not to think about my life back home, but sometimes it sneaks in, uninvited",neutral,0
 What the hell am I going to do when I get back home?,angry,0
 Should I take the job Jamie offered me? Should I stay in Salem?,neutral,0
 These questions completely depress me,sad,0
 Completely,neutral,0
 so i've discovered a new superpowe (and yes i do have others),surprise,0
 i can dream and earthquake and it'll actually happen!!!,surprise,0
 that's not entirely true,neutral,0
" what really happened was that an earthquake started and instead of waking up first i incorporated it into a dream where i was watching a documentary about earthquakes and they were ""recounting"" some classic earthquake showing how it would pulse stronger and stronger",neutral,0
 keep in mind my bed is lofted about 4. high and i was hungover after having slept 4 hours,neutral,0
" i was very attentive, and it didn't seem like she was gonna break, so i just stayed there and eventually it stopped and i passed out again",neutral,0
 then my bro calls,neutral,0
 i'm too lazy to pick it up,neutral,0
" then he calls again and, knowing that's the international sign for ""pick up the frickin' phone,"" i picked it up thinkin' there was something wrong with him",angry,0

" eitherw ay, finally got up for a while after talkin' to him and my sis and mom, listened to the radio for a little while (on my MP3 player 'cause the power was knocked out) and it was all fine",neutral,0
" so i went back to sleep 'till noon, took beau for a walk, surfed for four hours, cooked in the dark, read by candlelight for a little while, adn then the power came back on so i could watch tv",neutral,0
" all in all, an interesting sunday",happy,0
 all my plans were shot to shit 'cause the cell waves were all packed and i couldn't get in touch with my friends very well,disgust,0
 and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help,neutral,0
 yeah,neutral,0
 useless day,disgust,0
" then i needed a drink and naturally don't have beer, and i expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm",neutral,0
 so i made a martini,neutral,0
 that i'm still trying to finish,neutral,0
 this fuckers don't go down too easy,angry,0
" oh, earthquake was rated highest at a 6",neutral,0
 what surprised me most (geekin' it up) was the frequency of the rumbles,surprise,0
 hum,neutral,0
 definitely in the audible range and very regular,neutral,0
 then it would relax again,neutral,0
 but yeah,neutral,0
 didn't rumble like,neutral,0
 say,neutral,0
 an avalanche (movie sounds) or rock slide,neutral,0
 or how they make them sound in movies,neutral,0
 it hummed,neutral,0
 the amount of energy required to move that much mass SUSTAINED at such a high frequency is ridiculous,surprise,0
" Earlier this week, Karina had invited me over to her townhouse",neutral,0
" She said that Kubik would be hanging out, and I could come if I wanted",neutral,0
" I got there a little after 7, Project Runway reruns playing on Bravo, and I asked, ""Where's Kubik?"" because she's usually very punctual",neutral,0
" I take a seat in the armchair across from Karina, and while she's talking, a face appears in the window behind her, grinning and waving enthusiastically",happy,0
" I jump, shrieking a little before I realize it's only Kubik",surprise,0
" Kubik gets a plate for her Chipotle burrito, and I ask for tea to dilute the effects of the two cups of coffee I had earlier",neutral,0
" Karina prepared a plate of 3 cheeses, red peppers, crackers, and we settle in front of the TV for some Project Runway",neutral,0
" Original plan was to watch Brokeback Mountain, but I saw that 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate is on, and ask if we can watch that",neutral,0
" The two of them watch it, I half watch the movie while reading the newspaper, sometimes out loud, but Kubik complains, ""SOMEONE IS TALKING while I'm trying to watch a movie!!"" but Karina defends me, ""You're one to talk",neutral,0
" This is too intense,"" with Karina asking if she needs to step outside",neutral,0
" We watch Project Runway, but the repetition of the same 5 commercials becomes old fast",neutral,0
" Around 1 pm, Karina tells us that we need to leave because it's late",neutral,0
" Haha, except nicer",happy,0
" Sunday afternoon, Erica, Diana, and I are going to the Spy Museum",neutral,0
" As I'm walking to the metro station, a teenage boy in his mixed group of 4 or 5 friends hanging outside yells, ""I like your haircut!"" and I answer, ""Thanks,"" while I keep walking having seen Erica and Diana enter a little bit earlier",neutral,0
 A compliment from a trendy teenager can brighten up anyone's day,happy,0
" The three of us find our way to the Spy Museum and I'm surprised by the number of young couples who are there, in addition to the usual elderly tourists and young families",surprise,0
" I'm the slowest to go through the exhibits, and I soon lose Erica and Diana, occasionally catching up with them when they slow down",neutral,0
" On the first floor, they have a crawlspace you can go through",neutral,0
" It's carpeted, so not too hard on the knees, and I see that someone left behind their brochure",neutral,0
" The fake vent opens to another part of the exhibit, and I get out",neutral,0
" While I'm looking at an exhibit on bugging devices, this kid comes up behind me and hands me the pamphlet, ""You dropped this",neutral,0
" Later, there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up, but our timing is never quite right",neutral,0
 We stop in the gift shop before heading home,neutral,0
" Diana finds a book, and Erica picks up some souvenirs for her family",neutral,0
" The wind blows strongly outside, and Diana has a hard time pushing open the door, but a 7 or 8 year old boy who's already exited with his family helps her out by pulling while she pushes",neutral,0
 I woke up early and checked on my little Chirp,neutral,0
 It was cute,happy,0
 I dipped my finger into the water and she drank the water that collected on it when I put it close to her,neutral,0
" She is looking better than she did, but hasn't eaten anything, so I hope she continues to heal",neutral,0
" I had to fly out the door this morning and ended up being 10 minutes late for class, but we were doing a group project, so I dived in and did my part",neutral,0
" Josh a. a the creep, who I'm in the group with, has been tolerable",neutral,0
 I think he knows not to cross the line he crossed once before,neutral,0
" So, we finished the group work and I decided just to head home",neutral,0
 There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing,neutral,0
 I did spend some time on the Live Journal looking for pictures/ userpics,neutral,0
 I do love the Chun Li pictures I found,happy,0

 Mrangelmeg and I took his cousin Lilli to St Meinrad with us on Friday evening for a couple of functions that happened to be going on that evening in conjunction with this semester's lay student class weekend,neutral,0
" As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed",happy,0
" The first was the dedication of a painting that was donated to the school by the students of Fr Damien Dietlein OSB, the Old Testament Professor there",neutral,0
" The picture is called Exodus and is of Moses and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, painted by an Ethiopian artist who currently lives in South Dakota",neutral,0
 The entire enterprise was done as a surprise to Damo (our name for Father) and he was genuinely touched and surprised by the affair,surprise,0
" The other activity was the inaugural session of Theology in the Round, a session intended to bring Seminarians, Lay Students and Alumni together for an evening of discussion surrounding a topic chosen by a guest speaker",neutral,0
 The evening's speaker happened to be another of my professors: Fr,neutral,0
 Denis Robinson OSB whom I had for Early Church History and had been telling mrangelmeg about for months,neutral,0
 His topic was John Henry Newman and Catholic Education,neutral,0
 I really wanted mrangelmeg to have a chance to experience Fr,neutral,0
 Denis because he is a force with which to be reckoned,neutral,0
" After that discussion we spent some time in the little bar on campus which is called the Unstable ( Benedictines take a vow of stability, so they call the bar, the Unstable, get it?)",neutral,0
 visiting with all my friends who are there for class this weekend while I am not,neutral,0
" I do miss them so very much, though I don't miss class at all",sad,0
 We had a wonderful time,happy,0
 And we got to see the Extreme Makeover Home Edition house in St,neutral,0
 How cool was that?,happy,0
" I have to admit, knowing that those of my friends who were there for Fr",neutral,0
 Denis' class on Creed were having a quiz on Heresies in the early church on Saturday morning I was more than happy to be returning home Friday night,happy,0
" And forget the Internet, where as much as 75% of all information is general nonsense",neutral,0
 Enter stage left: Daniel's Five Minute Guides,neutral,0
 something the Internet has been missing since it was born!,neutral,0
" Try out this first primer, a quick five minute guide to learning and loving classical music",neutral,0
" Five minutes is all you need, so grab a glass of your favorite wine, and enjoy your newfound knowledge!",happy,0
" If these prissy little installments are truly helpful, I may just have to take more requests!",neutral,0
 Classical Music 101,neutral,0
 Welcome to the world of classical music,neutral,0
" It's my world, a place where music in endless forms and varieties give me an entire lifetime of listening pleasure",happy,0
" It's the oldest recognized type of music in Western civilization, and it dates back well into the Middle Ages",neutral,0
" Since classical music is the oldest and largest genre of music in existence, let's study this music from one era to the next",neutral,0
" Most music historians identify anywhere from four to seven distinct eras in classical music, and since I recognize all seven, let's learn about each one:",neutral,0
1,neutral,0
 Middle Ages (450 A.  to 1450 A.),neutral,0
" Our first composers were mostly supported by the church (surprise!), and religion influenced early classical music more than any other source",surprise,0
" There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming",neutral,0
 Gregorian chants were written during these ancient times,neutral,0
2,neutral,0
" Renaissance (1450 - 1600): Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts",neutral,0
" Music became more of an expressive art than a science, and music was now being printed, allowing sacred, secular, and instrumental music to spread everywhere",neutral,0
 Governments now influenced the spread of the era's music more than the church,neutral,0
 Claudio Montiverdi was one of the most prominent composers of this era,neutral,0
3,neutral,0
" Baroque (1600-1750): The era of Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi saw the development of almost every modern instrument in use today, particularly the violin, clarinet, and piano",neutral,0
" Composers developed the idea of the sonata, the concerto, and the symphony, where great performers (called virtuosos) found enormous success",neutral,0
" Composers used counterpoint, dance rhythms and repetition in their music",neutral,0
4,neutral,0
 Think of this brief period as a launch platform of all the modern music to follow,neutral,0
 Just kidding,happy,0
" Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time",neutral,0
" You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven (both of whom didn't know they were writing ""classical"")",neutral,0
" They used simple ideas, simple textures, and simple forms, all of which make for great listening material",neutral,0
5,neutral,0
" Romantic (1825-1900): Lush and beautiful music was the prevailing theme during most of the 1800s, and music was written to tell stories, to depict the mysteries of nature, or to express the upper reaches of human emotions",neutral,0
" Composers of this era such as Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Chopin wrote music with a wider dynamic range, using a larger variety of instruments",neutral,0
" Female composers gained more visibility during this period, such as Clara Schumann",neutral,0
6,neutral,0
" 20th Century: 1900-1999: Classical music exploded, evolved and splintered faster than it ever had before",neutral,0
" New subcategories of classical music were born every year, and more composers were writing music than all previous eras combined",neutral,0
" Music of this era was influenced by anything and everything, including world wars, politics, SEX, and cross-pollination by other types of music such as jazz",neutral,0
" And anything and everything was possible, from atonal to experimental to electronic",neutral,0
" Finally, music could be recorded and distributed widely, creating a burgeoning market for all types of new music",neutral,0
" Over one hundred thousand composers fall into this period, including Copland, Stravinsky, and Ravel",neutral,0
" Needless to say, neither the church nor the government contributed much to classical music in this century",neutral,0
7,neutral,0

 Measure 40 amends the state constitution to require supreme court and appeals judges to be elected by district instead of the statewide vote that currently happens,neutral,0
 Arguments in favor: 29,neutral,0
 Arguments in opposition: 20,neutral,0
" 8 of the ""pro"" arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges",neutral,0
 Both sides have a mixture of more polemic arguments and more reasonable arguments,neutral,0
" There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas (think every rural area) will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc",neutral,0
" All in all, most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other",neutral,0
 One of the few that seemed to me to say something worth saying was an argument in favor that was written by Ron Saxton,neutral,0
" This surprised me, because I know from TV ads that Ron Saxton is running for something or other",surprise,0
" As such I consider him to be primarily a politician, and it is rare that I find what I might consider words of wisdom from a politician, even when I agree with them",neutral,0
" The one other somewhat-convincing argument was immediately after that one, also in favor, by an organization of Oregon farmers",neutral,0
 They talked about how it would be nice if some of the appellate judges understood how farms operate when lawsuits against farmers come up,neutral,0
" There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else",neutral,0

" The state of Iraq, what the Iraqi people want, all of that jazz, it's never spoken of at times like these",neutral,0
" All that matters is that terrorists want us out of Iraq, so that means we have to stay",neutral,0
" I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists, it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists",neutral,0

" (I can't find any good images of the weird displays, so to view some you have to look here at the International Body Worlds Online Store",neutral,0
" Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base",neutral,0
 Body Worlds is great in that it gives everyday people the chance to look at the machinery that is the body,neutral,0
" Now, people can see that organs are not the cartoonish objects that one sees in a book",neutral,0
" The general public also has a chance to look at diseased organs (something usually reserved for pathologists, who, I've noticed, seem to get *very* excited over things like polyps and necrosis",happy,0
 They have the blood vessels of various limbs that have been injected with polymers so that you can witness the intricacies of the blood supply,neutral,0
 The basic anatomy and bodies in motion portions are a must see,neutral,0
" However, for me, the more ""artistic"" exhibits were more of a turn off - I willingly admit that I was very attached to my cadaver in Gross, and the thought of him being displayed like that makes me a bit sick",disgust,0

 We scored twelve runs in the 4th inning because of some shoddy defense by Marco's team,neutral,0
 Let's just say they gave us at least five outs but probably more,neutral,0
 The inning would just never end,neutral,0
 I had quite a few homeruns and was involved on the wrong side of a great defensive play turned in by Joe Twarogowski,neutral,0
" In the 3rd inning, I tried to score when a throw to third base got away",neutral,0

" When I asked him whether he was all right, he said he was and proceeded to tell me that he knew it was coming",neutral,0

 This play remains perdurably etched in baseball history as the greatest play at the plate of all time,neutral,0
" Jim Hickman lines a base hit to center, Amos Otis comes up firing to the plate, the third base coach, Leo Durocher waves Pete Rose home, the throw brings then Indians' catcher, Ray Fosse a few feet up the line, and then it happens",neutral,0
 Pete Rose knocks Ray Fosse into baseball lore and permanantly knocks his shoulder into a somewhat more precarious place,fear,0
" Pete Rose scores the game-winning run and Ray Fosse, the Indians' seemingly promising beacon, is never the same ball player",neutral,0
" So, in the end, we held on to win by a score of 18-13",neutral,0
 Joe was fine after taking one of the hardest shots any catcher has ever taken in the six years we've been playing ball together,neutral,0
 That is probably the reason most leagues have banned the runner from destroying the catcher like that,neutral,0
" Yes, injuries can happen but, as a former catcher, it's the most exhilarating play in sports",happy,0

 Joe said it doesn't happen that often so it doesn't bother him,neutral,0
 It would if it were a constant occurence but that was the first time this year that we had had a collision at home plate and probably the last,neutral,0

 I jumped in front of home plate and the ball deflected off my glove and Joe just crushed me,neutral,0
 I landed by the ball and picked it up with my bare hand,neutral,0
" I turned around and swiped at Joe and missed as he hit home plate with his foot and his whole team just raced to the plate and mobbed him as they won, 7-6",neutral,0
 Ahsan says he still remembers that play,neutral,0
 He says he and Joe knew we were loading the bases for their two worst hitters to get the game into extra innings so they devised a play that involved Joe's trying to steal home,neutral,0
 Ahsan told me that he remembers the collision mostly because the game was being played in the rain and we very rarely play when it's raining,neutral,0
 He saw us sprawled out on the ground and thought for sure Joe was out,neutral,0
 Then he saw the ball lying on the ground and screamed for Joe to touch home,neutral,0

" Anyway, the smart part of me says to go to Jason's, make some cash, get stronger, get ready and train my leg to be stronger (like I did on my bike",neutral,0

 I checked two poltergeist books out of the library today,neutral,0
" The other is appalling crap: disorganized, blatantly pseudoscientific, and misogynistic",disgust,0

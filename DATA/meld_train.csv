"Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnt actually land on the moon.",neutral,0
"But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.",joy,0
"Wait a minute, I cant give this to her.",neutral,0
Why not?,neutral,0
"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom.",neutral,0
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!,anger,0

No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,surprise,0
"No, I know! I get it! Its funny!",joy,0
"No, because youre not a grandmother!",sadness,0
"No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I dont have any of those things.",sadness,0
Thats why its so funny.,neutral,0
All you had to do was buy the card!,anger,0
"Hey, Joey. What's going on?",neutral,0

Well thats a little crazy. Although I am yknow glad to hear that youre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,neutral,0
"Yeah, well Yknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",neutral,0
Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,anger,0

"Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check every rest stop, and, and also 93?",neutral,0
Okay!,neutral,0
"Yeah, no they dont do that.",neutral,0
"Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.",neutral,0
Who?,anger,0
I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half?,fear,0
"I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.",neutral,0
"No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!",anger,0
But if...,fear,0
"No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, youll have to think of something else.",anger,0

"Yeah, Im pretty confident about that.",neutral,0
Thats what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler!,joy,0
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.,neutral,0
What do you mean?,neutral,0
"Well yknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyre 40, they marry each other.",neutral,0
You mean a backup?,neutral,0
Exactly!,joy,0
"Yeah, yeah I got that.",neutral,0

"Umm, do you know each others hometowns?",neutral,0
Why dont you   Wh-whats going on?,fear,0
"Well, umm, not much.",neutral,0
"But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yknow?",neutral,0
"So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?",neutral,0
"Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whats wrong with Monica and Chandler?",neutral,0

What?,neutral,0
"Im just saying, this woman, I mean shes fictitious. No?",surprise,0
Why would you say that?,neutral,0
Cause youre still into Monica.,neutral,0
"So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...",neutral,0
Youre good. Youre good!,joy,0
"Yeah, no, Im fairly intuitive and psychic. Its a substantial gift.",neutral,0
"Listen, can you promise me that you wont tell her though?",fear,0

Thanks a lot.,neutral,0

"All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?",neutral,0
You blew them away!,joy,0
"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face!",joy,0
"I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?",neutral,0

I went to Rosss!,neutral,0
I went to the coffeehouse!,neutral,0
I went to any place that they made sandwiches!,neutral,0
"Thats the day youre gonna die? Seedarnit, Ive got shuffleboard that day.",neutral,0
Thats what you think.,neutral,0
"Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmothers? Wouldnt they have the recipe?",neutral,0
"Well, yknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.",neutral,0
What was her name?,neutral,0
Nestley Toulouse.,neutral,0
Nestlé Toll House?,neutral,0
"Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.",neutral,0
Yes!!  Oh.,surprise,0
I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!,anger,0
I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why  youre burning in hell!!,anger,0
"So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?",neutral,0
Absolutely!,joy,0
I am so on board!,joy,0
Rachel didn't you just light that?,neutral,0
"Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.",neutral,0
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.,neutral,0

It does sound appealing.,neutral,0
"Oh, I never could do it.",joy,0
Oh but you could.,neutral,0
You can.,neutral,0
Absolutely!,joy,0
We can help each other out!,joy,0
We can get--what are those--those patches!,neutral,0
We could be like the Patch Sisters!,joy,0
"Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!",joy,0
Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!,joy,0
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.,sadness,0
Okay then!,joy,0
"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?",neutral,0
"Does, um, anyone wanna see?",neutral,0
Nooo..,disgust,0
"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!",anger,0
It's worse than the thumb!,disgust,0
"Hey, this is so unfair!",anger,0
"Oh, why is it unfair?",surprise,0
So I have a flaw!,anger,0
Big deal!,anger,0
Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?,anger,0
"And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word?",anger,0
"And Monica, with that snort when she laughs?",anger,0
"I mean, what the hell is that thing?",disgust,0
"...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?",anger,0
...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?,anger,0
"Well, I-I could live without it.",neutral,0
"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?",neutral,0
"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.",neutral,0
"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?",anger,0
"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.",neutral,0
"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.",joy,0
"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.",neutral,0
"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.",anger,0
Awww! Mel Torme died.,sadness,0

Aw! Does that mean the,sadness,0
Hey.,neutral,0
Hey.,neutral,0
You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,neutral,0
"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",neutral,0
Probably?,neutral,0
"Yeah, I don't like that word.",disgust,0
Kind of what probably really means.,neutral,0
"Yeah, uh-huh.",neutral,0
"Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow?",anger,0
"I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!""",anger,0
You gotta take care of yourselves!,neutral,0
In,neutral,0
"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?",neutral,0
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.,joy,0
Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesnt he?,joy,0
Hes a keeper. How are you feeling?,neutral,0
"Oh, Im fine.",neutral,0
"Can I just say, I really admire what youre doing. Just raising her all alone.",neutral,0
"Oh, Im not doing it alone. I have Ross.",neutral,0
"Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?",neutral,0
"Well then he gets a divorce, its Ross!",neutral,0
"Im telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say theyre gonna be there until they start their real family.",neutral,0
Well IThats never gonna happen with Ross.,sadness,0
"Oh well thats what I thought about my first husband, now Im lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.",disgust,0
"And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.",neutral,0
Hey. Whos that?,neutral,0
New people.,neutral,0
What happened to the Disgustingtons?,neutral,0
Theyre having their baby!,anger,0
Its not fair Ross we got here first!,anger,0
Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery.,neutral,0
Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.,neutral,0
"Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?",surprise,0
Phoebe?,neutral,0
Yeah?,neutral,0
"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",surprise,0
"Hes awfully short and I think hes talking to himself. And to be completely honest, hes not that good in bed.",neutral,0
"Oh, what is wrong with me lately?",sadness,0
I mean its like every guy I seeI mean look here.,neutral,0
"Look at that guy for example, I mean normally thats not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way Im feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",neutral,0
"Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?",neutral,0
Yeah.,neutral,0
"This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.",neutral,0
Really?! So this has happened to you?,surprise,0
Oh absolutely yeah!,neutral,0
"Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, yknow, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.",neutral,0
"Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santas lap.",joy,0
"Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a",neutral,0
Ugh!,disgust,0
I dont know what Im going to do!,fear,0
I called the company that sent and th-they dont care!,anger,0

Hey guys!,joy,0
Hey!,joy,0
Hey,neutral,0
"I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party!",joy,0
And the guys from work had a blast.,joy,0
"Yknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.",joy,0
Yeah!,joy,0
"And-and another one had never been to a party before, so",surprise,0
"So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thats nice!",joy,0
"Yeah, right!",joy,0
"I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those",neutral,0
"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",surprise,0
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",surprise,0
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",joy,0
"So you might say, its a magic ring.",joy,0
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!,surprise,0
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,neutral,0
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",neutral,0
"Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her",neutral,0
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,neutral,0
"Thats interesting, but check this out. I date her",joy,0
Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,neutral,0
"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",neutral,0
Yeah well we should order some food then.,neutral,0
"No Joey! Look why dont, why dont we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, well",neutral,0
That sounds fair.,neutral,0
Maybe Ill take her to that new French restaurant down the street,neutral,0
Ah yeahwait a second now!,anger,0
Look were gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,neutral,0
I dont have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,anger,0
"Well sorry, thats what I do on dates.",neutral,0
"All right, well I guess Ill just have to do what I do on dates.",neutral,0
So lets decide on the spending limit,neutral,0
"Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?",neutral,0
I was thinking more like a hundred.,neutral,0
Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?,neutral,0
"Hi, again.",neutral,0
Hey!,neutral,0
Hey!,neutral,0
"Thank you soo, much.",joy,0
"Oh, dont thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.",anger,0
You want some help with that?,neutral,0
"Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I dont!",neutral,0
Whoa! Are you okay?,surprise,0
"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",surprise,0
Its the heat.  And-and the humidity.,neutral,0
"Thats a uh, thats a tough combination.",neutral,0
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,neutral,0
Like you wouldnt believe.  Wow! This is a great place.,surprise,0
What do you mean?,neutral,0
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.,neutral,0

"Yeah, thats what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!",disgust,0
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?,neutral,0
"Joey, why dont you put them in the lost and found?",neutral,0
Theres a lost and found?  My shoe!,surprise,0
You left a shoe here?!,surprise,0
"Well, I didnt realize until I got home.",neutral,0
I wasnt gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!,neutral,0
Im gonna go find that guys car and leave a note on the windshield.,neutral,0
"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Ill be sure to give him your shoe.",neutral,0
Great! Thanks.,joy,0
"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.",neutral,0
"Carol, we've been through this before, ok?",joy,0
We have a good time.,joy,0
"We laugh, we play.",joy,0
It's like we're father and son.,joy,0
"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.",joy,0

"Did you just say Hi, Jew?",surprise,0
"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.",neutral,0
Now there you go! I wouldnt want my best guest to strain her eyes!,joy,0
Thanks Monica!,joy,0
Does that smell bother you?,disgust,0
"What the smell from Joeys? No, I can hardly smell it over here.",surprise,0
"Well you let me know if you can, because yknow I can bake a pie to cover it.",neutral,0
"I can smell it a little, bake the pie.",joy,0
Okay!,joy,0
Okay.,neutral,0
"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  Its for you. Its the fire inspector.",neutral,0
Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!,surprise,0
"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnt the hair straightener that started the fire.",neutral,0
"No-no, it was the candles.",neutral,0
Its very not good leaving candles unattended.,neutral,0
"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.",neutral,0
"Well, I have to go now.",neutral,0
Joey proposed to me.,surprise,0
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,surprise,0
"Well, I-I said yes.",fear,0

Are you crazy?,anger,0
You just had Ross’s baby!,anger,0
It’s-it’s so  inappropriate.,anger,0
"No, it’s worse than that.",disgust,0
It’s wrong.,disgust,0
It’s… It is bigger than  mine!,surprise,0
I know.,neutral,0
You can’t marry him!,sadness,0
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet  guy and he loves me so much.,sadness,0
Well do you love him?,neutral,0
Sure.,neutral,0
Sure?,neutral,0
"Yeah, I mean whatever.",neutral,0
"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",sadness,0
"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",sadness,0
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,neutral,0
Here comes the bride.,joy,0
Oh my God Monica!,surprise,0
I wanna wear this everyday.,joy,0
You look so beautiful.,joy,0
Im so happy for me.,joy,0
Hello?,neutral,0

"Yeah, we got him back. Everythings fine.",neutral,0
Damnit!,anger,0
"I will be! Listen, I dont want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?",anger,0
Fine.,neutral,0
"Fine, but Ill have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",anger,0
And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but Ill go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if thats what you want!,anger,0
"No thats not what I want. Uh, Im glad you guys were bonding but I",neutral,0
"Look he doesnt have any brothers or sisters, somebodys gonna have to teach him this stuff!",sadness,0
And I havent taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesnt know anyway!,neutral,0
Crap!!,anger,0
I gotta go!,neutral,0
Look at that! Look at that! Theyre going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?,surprise,0

"Oh thats all right, I have it memorized. Its 1A.",neutral,0
Okay!,joy,0
Yknow what?,neutral,0
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.,joy,0
All I really needed was a plan.,neutral,0
See I wanna have three kids,neutral,0
"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",joy,0
As I was saying I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time Im 35 which gives me five years.,neutral,0
You spent a hundred dollars. Thats the limit. Youre screwed!,joy,0
"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",anger,0
Oh-oh! So thats the way its gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too yknow!,anger,0
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,anger,0
I dont know.,neutral,0
Why am I not surprised?,disgust,0
Yknow what Ross? Im not gonna let you get away with this!,anger,0
I dont think you have much choice.,neutral,0
Well well see!,anger,0
Bye-bye!,neutral,0

Hey!,surprise,0
"Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.",joy,0
"Dad, we-we cant believe youre selling the house.",sadness,0
"Well, its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",neutral,0
Lets grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,neutral,0
Im sorry we cant store your childhood things anymore.,sadness,0
"Oh, thats okay, I cant wait to see everything again! All of the memories",joy,0
"Well, I dont know whats in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven",neutral,0
I used to,neutral,0
"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",neutral,0
"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a",neutral,0
"Ok, got the vent open.",neutral,0
"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",joy,0
"Ben, you ready?",neutral,0
"All right, gimme your foot.",neutral,0
"Ok, on three, Ben.",neutral,0
"One, two, three.",neutral,0
"Ok, That's it, Ben.",neutral,0

"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!",surprise,0
Wait! You forgot your legs!,surprise,0
"You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.",joy,0
Thank you.,joy,0
Filing system?,neutral,0
Oh-oh!,surprise,0
You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?,neutral,0
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,joy,0
"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",neutral,0
I notice that youve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,neutral,0
"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",joy,0
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Its amazing how she gets it right almost,joy,0
"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",neutral,0
"Oh yes, well theres the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",joy,0
"Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",neutral,0
"Yes, I realize that",neutral,0
"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral,0
I love working with designers!,joy,0
"With them, under them, whats the difference? Eh, Rach?",neutral,0
"Chandler, you have an assistant right?",neutral,0
Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!,fear,0
"Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.",neutral,0

"Yeah!  All right, maybe you dont have to smile. Lets try something else. Lets try umm, try looking sexy.",neutral,0
Okay.,neutral,0
Or not.,neutral,0
Where's Chandler?,neutral,0
Here I am.,neutral,0
Wash your hands!!!,disgust,0
How did youknow?,surprise,0
Hey! What's she doing back here?,surprise,0
"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",neutral,0
"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",neutral,0
What happened in Atlantic City?!,surprise,0
"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar",neutral,0
"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",anger,0
"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?",neutral,0
"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",neutral,0
"Now, I know what youre thinking, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and youre right, Chandlers not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.",joy,0
You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,surprise,0
"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",anger,0
"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard",joy,0
"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",anger,0
"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",neutral,0
"So umm, youre gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",neutral,0
Of course I am!,joy,0
"Oh mom, I swear Im not an idiot.",neutral,0
"Ive read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didnt think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.",neutral,0
And-and then guess what?,neutral,0
The babys coming and I dont know what to do.,sadness,0
"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",sadness,0
"No. Sweetie, youre gonna be fine.",neutral,0
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,fear,0

Okay.,neutral,0
Now dont worry! Everythings gonna be okay.,neutral,0

Hey!,joy,0
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?,surprise,0
I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.,neutral,0
Not if you were here.,neutral,0
"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",neutral,0
Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope its you!,joy,0
I hope its you.,neutral,0
Me too!,joy,0
"First of all um, I love you both so much and youre both so important to me",joy,0
"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",joy,0
"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",neutral,0
"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",neutral,0
Yes!!! Oh!!,joy,0
Hypothetically!,anger,0
Still.,neutral,0
If Phoebe were my maid of honor,neutral,0
"Rachel would be Phoebes, I would be Rachels, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",neutral,0
Yeah thats actually a pretty good idea.,neutral,0
"Yeah, Ill do that. So who gets to be yours?",neutral,0
"Well thats the best part. Umm,",neutral,0
Wh-why is that the best part?,surprise,0
Because then I dont have to!,joy,0
Well of,neutral,0
Im really not deciding!,joy,0
Fine!,anger,0
"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!",joy,0
"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway?",neutral,0
It's not just the drum noise.,neutral,0
"Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye!",anger,0
"Oh god, my eye!""",anger,0
"I mean, it is so annoying.",anger,0
"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",neutral,0
"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",surprise,0
Maybe on some level.,neutral,0
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,surprise,0
"No, Im picking you up for our date. These are for you.",neutral,0
"Ohh, Lilies. Joey, theyre my favorite. Thank you.",joy,0
"And, a brownie!",joy,0
"Well, half a brownie.",neutral,0

"Ah Hey, so this roommate of yoursis he good looking?",joy,0
Hm-mmm,neutral,0
"Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?",neutral,0
"Yeah, but Im pretty sure hes gay.",neutral,0
"No-no-no-no, hes not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!",anger,0
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?,anger,0
"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.",neutral,0
"Ha. Ha, ha.",joy,0
What?,neutral,0
"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black.",neutral,0
Please! I am not as bad as Ross.,disgust,0
"Oh, I beg to differ. The",neutral,0
That was,neutral,0
Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!,joy,0
"Well, not playing raquetball!",surprise,0
He forgot to leave his grip size!,surprise,0
He didn't get the goggles!,surprise,0
"Well,sounds like you two have issues.",neutral,0
"Goodbye, baby.",neutral,0
"Ciao, bela.",neutral,0
Do they wait for me to do this?,neutral,0
So are you gonna tell him?,neutral,0
Why would I tell him?,neutral,0
"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.",neutral,0
What are you guys doing here?,anger,0
Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!,surprise,0
...What did I ask?,neutral,0
God. I feel violated.,disgust,0
"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?",disgust,0
"Ross, ten o'clock.",neutral,0
Is it? Feels like two.,sadness,0
"No,",neutral,0
"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!",joy,0
Oh. Hel-lo!,joy,0
"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!",joy,0
"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.",joy,0
"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'",fear,0
"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!",joy,0
"Oh please, could she",neutral,0
He could never get a woman like that in a million years.,neutral,0
"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.",neutral,0
You could do that!,joy,0
You think?,surprise,0
"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.",neutral,0
OK.,neutral,0
"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?",joy,0
"Thank you Helen, that'll be all.",neutral,0
"Last time I do that, I promise.",neutral,0
"I am so, so, so, so sorry!",sadness,0
Uh-huh.,disgust,0
"And I will cook anything you want in here , and do anything in there!",fear,0
"Yeah you will!  And, are you kiddin me?!",anger,0
"Come on Monica, its our Valentines Day. Please? Please-please, please?",sadness,0
Okay.,neutral,0
Okay.,neutral,0
"So, are we going in there?",neutral,0
I am!!,joy,0
Wow!,surprise,0
It actually is in the handbook.,neutral,0
I cant date you or have a hot plate in my office.,neutral,0
I cant believe we have to stop seeing each other.,sadness,0
For what its worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.,joy,0
"I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we cant date. Its against the rules. Its forbidden.",neutral,0
Wow!,surprise,0
What?,surprise,0
"Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, its really hot.",joy,0
Really?,surprise,0
Yeah.,neutral,0
"Well I-I-I dont care how hot it is its-its uh, its wrong.",joy,0
Stop it!,joy,0
No! No! Its wrong! Its-its-its naughty. Its taboo.,joy,0
Shut the book!,joy,0
Lets also get a hot plate!,joy,0
"Rach, youre in a great place in your life. Come on, youve got a great job! Good friends",joy,0
Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?,joy,0
"Oh Im not, I just like to try these on.",neutral,0
I do the same thing.,neutral,0
Im just kidding. Im getting married July 25,joy,0
Im just kidding too.  Im getting married in December.,joy,0
So when are you getting married?,neutral,0
Oh May 15,neutral,0
Oooh its getting close!,joy,0
"So uh, whos your photographer?",neutral,0
Jeffrey,neutral,0
We met with him. Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding he did?,neutral,0
The best man? Wow!,surprise,0
"I know! I almost called off my wedding. Oh, whos your band?!",joy,0
"Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.",neutral,0
"Oh, youre so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.",sadness,0
"Ooh, is that spelled with a C or a K? Oh my God! It doesnt matter; theyre both great!",joy,0
Oh yknow what?,neutral,0
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinmans and get it half off.,neutral,0
This place is so overpriced.,disgust,0
"So, does this  come in another color or",neutral,0
"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time.",neutral,0
It was unbelievable!,surprise,0
"We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...",joy,0
So have you called her yet?,neutral,0
Let her know I like her?,fear,0
"What are you, insane?",anger,0
It's the next day!,joy,0
How needy do I want to seem?,neutral,0
"I'm right, right?",neutral,0
"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.",neutral,0
I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,surprise,0
"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",anger,0
"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.",neutral,0
Her answer machine?,neutral,0
"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",neutral,0
"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",neutral,0
"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",disgust,0
"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",surprise,0
"Okay, okay, what's going on?",neutral,0
"Okay, they're just talking...",neutral,0
"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?",neutral,0
"So, um, what do you do for a living?",neutral,0
"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.",neutral,0
Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.,neutral,0
I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.,sadness,0
Now that is funny.,neutral,0
"Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?",neutral,0
"Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.",sadness,0
I guess.,neutral,0
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?,neutral,0
"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.",neutral,0

Okay.,neutral,0
When I was six years old.,neutral,0
Hm-mm,neutral,0
I wanted a big wheel.,neutral,0
And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.,anger,0
"It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.",sadness,0
That was a pretty tough year.,sadness,0
Thats-thats great!,joy,0
See?,neutral,0
I already feel like I know you a little better!,joy,0
Thank you.,joy,0
"Okay, come on.",neutral,0
Now we can go eat.,neutral,0

That's patio furniture!,surprise,0
"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!",neutral,0
What about the birds?,neutral,0
"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""",neutral,0
You pick one.,neutral,0
"All right, how about the ladybugs?",neutral,0
"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!",anger,0
"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!",anger,0
"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds!",sadness,0

"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.",sadness,0
"Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, dont I have to wait a while?",sadness,0
"Hey, this isnt like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!",anger,0
Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.,neutral,0
"Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.",neutral,0
Why? What happened to him?,neutral,0
"Nothing, hes just really believes in that.",neutral,0
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.,neutral,0

"Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?""",surprise,0
"Um-hmm, five actually.",neutral,0
"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",neutral,0
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.,neutral,0
Thats it! 25 percent? That means thats its like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!,surprise,0
"Hey, yknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?",neutral,0
"Sweety, now, shes a woman, not a gumball machine.",neutral,0
"Okay, well yknow what, dont worry you guys, cause Im-Im gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.",neutral,0
"Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.",neutral,0
"Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.",neutral,0
"So, umm, were kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.",neutral,0
"Whoa!! Thatokay, thats a",disgust,0

You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!,surprise,0
"Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!",disgust,0
"Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!",anger,0
"I don't know, clean places?",neutral,0
"Mm, yum!",neutral,0
It's Danny.,neutral,0
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.,fear,0
We'll be right there!  Can't you just say it starts later?,anger,0

"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.",neutral,0
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.,joy,0
What?,neutral,0
They've arrested Monica.,sadness,0
Note the painterly lines    and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors    as his elusive subject was light itself.,neutral,0
"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",neutral,0
"No, no, my mouth    says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",neutral,0
"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt    M-O-N-A-Y.",neutral,0
I just...,neutral,0
I wrote that out phonetically for you.,neutral,0
Phonetically?,neutral,0
"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time    for this.",neutral,0
"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that    you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",surprise,0
"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days""    I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",joy,0
Wow. What does,surprise,0
No idea!,surprise,0
"But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",neutral,0
Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,neutral,0
"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",neutral,0
"Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing    and dude, you can't",anger,0

"And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!",joy,0
"So umm, does it?",neutral,0
Im sorry.,sadness,0
Does it?,fear,0
"Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole Does it? part just another glance.",neutral,0
"What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice!",anger,0
"Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesnt, and if you have to even",anger,0
"No, Rach, no. I dont, I dont, I dont",neutral,0

So thats your second marriage in two years.,neutral,0
"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",neutral,0
"Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client.",neutral,0
Why dont you tell me what happened.,neutral,0
"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk",neutral,0
"Im sorry, is this the same Rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage?",surprise,0
"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do",neutral,0
"Oh, thats better then.",neutral,0
This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,neutral,0
I see. Have you considered therapy?,neutral,0
I think just the,neutral,0
There are a couple of forms to fill out.,neutral,0
Easy.,neutral,0
"And well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.",neutral,0
No problem.,neutral,0
And well need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.,neutral,0
Ooh!,surprise,0
Theres no way to do this without her?,surprise,0
"Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",fear,0
"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.",neutral,0
"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.",neutral,0
"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed.",neutral,0
What?,surprise,0
"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it.",neutral,0
"That's alright, I'll take it.",neutral,0
Bad things happen to me anyway.,neutral,0
This way I can break 'em up with a movie.,neutral,0
"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...",neutral,0
You wanna do it right now?,neutral,0
Great!,joy,0
"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from",neutral,0

That's crazy!,surprise,0
You can't do that!,surprise,0
What are you going to tell her?,sadness,0
Oh God.,fear,0
"Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?",sadness,0
"It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.",sadness,0
"And I do, I have to make",sadness,0
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That,surprise,0
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.,sadness,0
"Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.",anger,0
What are you doing?,surprise,0
Storming out!,anger,0
"Rachel, this is your apartment.",neutral,0
"Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!",anger,0
These little women. Wow!,surprise,0

"We dont, really.",neutral,0
"Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?",neutral,0
"Oh yeah! Yeah, no, were gonna connect, y'know bond, and everything.",joy,0
"Yeah, I was thinking that maybe we could go down to Time Square and pick up some ninja stars.",neutral,0
"And, oh, um, my friend Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.",neutral,0
"You know, we dont really take advantage of living in the city.",neutral,0
"Okay, Chandler!",neutral,0
Okay.,neutral,0
"And your horoscope says, ""On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift.""",joy,0
"Oh, well thank you in advance.",joy,0

Oh my God! Its Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!,surprise,0
Oh thats right. Its your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?,joy,0
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series? Ive dreamed about this for years! Why have I not been preparing?!,joy,0
"No! Joey, youre going to be great!",neutral,0
"But I got to act with a robot Pheebs, and-and I dont know anything about technology!",fear,0
I cant even use Chandlers computer except to find porn!,anger,0
And-and thats only cause its right there when you turn it on!,anger,0

Oh my God! It sure didnt look this way when I lived here.,surprise,0

"Theres only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeys.",neutral,0
"Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.",sadness,0
"Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no ones fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.",neutral,0

This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.,neutral,0
"Sorry, that was wax.",neutral,0
"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.",sadness,0
Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?,disgust,0
During a blackout? He'd get trampled!,sadness,0
Yeah?,neutral,0
"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.",sadness,0
"But I'll still always come back, like this.",neutral,0
"And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.",neutral,0

"Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?",neutral,0
Oh yeah!,joy,0
"Well okay, so then youre fine.",neutral,0
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,neutral,0
Okay?,neutral,0
So as long as its hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,neutral,0
"Its when the heat goes away, thats when youre in trouble.",neutral,0

Why?  Seriously I did not understand a word that    you said.,surprise,0
In the hall.,neutral,0
"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping.",neutral,0
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.,neutral,0
"Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.",neutral,0
"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.",neutral,0
That's a good one!,joy,0
"Hey, Joe.",neutral,0

"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that.",neutral,0
"All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.",neutral,0
I don't know you guys.,fear,0
"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you.",disgust,0
"And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'",disgust,0
"And before you know it, she's with him.",anger,0
"And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!'",anger,0
"And he'll be all, 'Yes!'",anger,0
"And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.'",joy,0
"And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.'",disgust,0
"And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'",disgust,0

I knew I shouldnt have mentioned it! Thats what I wanted to name my kid!,sadness,0
"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.",sadness,0
I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!,surprise,0
"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...",joy,0

Wait! Youre going out with Kathy!,surprise,0
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,surprise,0

What is the big deal? Its not like were exclusive.,sadness,0
"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",anger,0
"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that shes-shes smart, and funny, and gets you.",neutral,0

"All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.",anger,0
"No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.",neutral,0
No. Thats not what Im saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.,neutral,0
I like that.,joy,0
"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.",neutral,0

"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.",anger,0

You got problems because of you!,anger,0
Not your name!,sadness,0
"All right, this has got to stop!",anger,0

"Do you my sisters teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?",anger,0
This isnt right.,neutral,0
"I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Im sure theyll come back when we can do it right.",sadness,0
I cant ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,anger,0
Dont you point your pants at me!,anger,0
We have no choice!,anger,0
"Anywhere thats half-decent wouldve be booked months ago, Ross dont you understand?",anger,0
This is our wedding Im talking about.,anger,0

So what are you saying? Its now or never?,anger,0
No. Im saying its now.,neutral,0
Or?,anger,0
Theres no or in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,anger,0
